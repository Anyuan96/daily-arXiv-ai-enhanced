TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种基于VLM下一个token概率的轻量化幻觉检测方法，显著提高了幻觉预测的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幻觉现象的存在削弱了VLMs的可信度，因此需要一种高效且低延迟的方法来检测这些幻觉。

Method: 通过训练传统机器学习模型并利用VLM的下一个token概率信号，进行即时的幻觉检测。

Result: 实验结果显示，基于NTP的特征能够有效预测幻觉，并且结合语言NTPs和VLMs预测评分后，幻觉检测性能得到了显著提升。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种基于下一个词概率（NTPs）的高效幻觉检测方法，能够显著提升视觉语言模型（VLMs）的可靠性。

Abstract: Hallucinations of vision-language models (VLMs), which are misalignments
between visual content and generated text, undermine the reliability of VLMs.
One common approach for detecting them employs the same VLM, or a different
one, to assess generated outputs. This process is computationally intensive and
increases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly
method for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over
signals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a
direct quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high
uncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations.
To test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements
derived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and
use it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that
NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and
simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs.
Furthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding
only the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection
performance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs
into the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or
NTPs alone. We hope this study paves the way for simple, lightweight solutions
that enhance the reliability of VLMs.

### [2] [Quasi-Synthetic Riemannian Data Generation for Writer-Independent Offline Signature Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20420)
*Elias N. Zois,Moises Diaz,Salem Said,Miguel A. Ferrer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于黎曼几何的准合成数据生成框架，用于无作者独立的手写签名验证，取得了较低的错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无作者独立的手写签名验证任务，特别是在模型需要跨未见个体进行泛化的情况下。

Method: 利用黎曼几何的对称正定矩阵(SPD)生成框架，通过小规模真实样本生成黎曼高斯混合模型，并进行度量学习。

Result: 在两个常用签名数据集上的实验表明，该方法在内部和跨数据集评估协议下表现良好，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的准合成方法在无作者独立签名验证系统中表现出低错误率，显示了在黎曼空间生成合成数据的潜力。

Abstract: Offline handwritten signature verification remains a challenging task,
particularly in writer-independent settings where models must generalize across
unseen individuals. Recent developments have highlighted the advantage of
geometrically inspired representations, such as covariance descriptors on
Riemannian manifolds. However, past or present, handcrafted or data-driven
methods usually depend on real-world signature datasets for classifier
training. We introduce a quasi-synthetic data generation framework leveraging
the Riemannian geometry of Symmetric Positive Definite matrices (SPD). A small
set of genuine samples in the SPD space is the seed to a Riemannian Gaussian
Mixture which identifies Riemannian centers as synthetic writers and variances
as their properties. Riemannian Gaussian sampling on each center generates
positive as well as negative synthetic SPD populations. A metric learning
framework utilizes pairs of similar and dissimilar SPD points, subsequently
testing it over on real-world datasets. Experiments conducted on two popular
signature datasets, encompassing Western and Asian writing styles, demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed approach under both intra- and cross- dataset
evaluation protocols. The results indicate that our quasi-synthetic approach
achieves low error rates, highlighting the potential of generating synthetic
data in Riemannian spaces for writer-independent signature verification
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一文本到图像生成、图像编辑和多图像组合，提升创作的互动性和多维度性。

Method: 结合高效的扩散变换器与强大的变分自编码器，并整合多种推理加速技术。

Result: Seedream 4.0 在文本到图像合成和多模态图像编辑任务上实现了先进的结果，具有出色的复杂任务处理能力。

Conclusion: Seedream 4.0 是一个高效的多模态图像生成系统，推动了生成 AI 在创意和专业应用中的边界。

Abstract: We introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image
generation system that unifies text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, image editing,
and multi-image composition within a single framework. We develop a highly
efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the
number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our
model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g.,
1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning
diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data
collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized
strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong
generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform
multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks
jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation,
distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It
achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image
(without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream
4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image
editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in
complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and
also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images.
This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and
multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both
creativity and professional applications. Seedream 4.0 is now accessible on
https://www.volcengine.com/experience/ark?launch=seedream.

### [4] [A Contrastive Learning Framework for Breast Cancer Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20474)
*Samia Saeed,Khuram Naveed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于对比学习的框架，能在小型标记数据集上实现高准确率的乳腺癌检测，达到96.7%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决深度学习方法中由于标记数据集有限而导致的准确性问题，提高早期乳腺癌的检测率。

Method: 使用对比学习的半监督方法训练Resnet-50，并在大量未标记的乳腺X光数据上应用各种数据增强和变换。

Result: 在INbreast和MIAS基准数据集上，检测乳腺癌的准确率达到了96.7%。

Conclusion: 该研究引入了对比学习框架，利用小型标记数据集实现高精度乳腺癌检测，表现优于现有技术。

Abstract: Breast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally,
accounts for a quarter of all cancer cases [1]. To lower this death rate, it is
crucial to detect tumors early, as early-stage detection significantly improves
treatment outcomes. Advances in non-invasive imaging techniques have made early
detection possible through computer-aided detection (CAD) systems which rely on
traditional image analysis to identify malignancies. However, there is a
growing shift towards deep learning methods due to their superior
effectiveness. Despite their potential, deep learning methods often struggle
with accuracy due to the limited availability of large-labeled datasets for
training. To address this issue, our study introduces a Contrastive Learning
(CL) framework, which excels with smaller labeled datasets. In this regard, we
train Resnet-50 in semi supervised CL approach using similarity index on a
large amount of unlabeled mammogram data. In this regard, we use various
augmentation and transformations which help improve the performance of our
approach. Finally, we tune our model on a small set of labelled data that
outperforms the existing state of the art. Specifically, we observed a 96.7%
accuracy in detecting breast cancer on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基础模型在公共数据集上效果显著，但在真实工业场景中表现不佳，显示了模型在实际应用中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在不同领域和数据集之间的通用性暗示它们可能适合用于系列生产中的自动质量检查，从而减少标签任务的繁琐。

Method: 测试多个最新的基础模型在自定义真实世界工业图像数据和公开图像数据上的表现。

Result: 所有测试的基础模型在我们的真实世界数据上表现不佳，而在公共基准数据集上表现良好。

Conclusion: 虽然基础模型在公共基准数据集上的表现良好，但在处理真实工业图像数据时却未能取得成功，这表明需要进一步研究以提高模型在实际应用中的有效性。

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have shown impressive performance on various text and
image processing tasks. They can generalize across domains and datasets in a
zero-shot setting. This could make them suitable for automated quality
inspection during series manufacturing, where various types of images are being
evaluated for many different products. Replacing tedious labeling tasks with a
simple text prompt to describe anomalies and utilizing the same models across
many products would save significant efforts during model setup and
implementation. This is a strong advantage over supervised Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models, which are trained for individual applications and
require labeled training data. We test multiple recent FMs on both custom
real-world industrial image data and public image data. We show that all of
those models fail on our real-world data, while the very same models perform
well on public benchmark datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个通用的神经空间架构，以提高多任务视觉处理的效率和泛化能力，适用于多种成像和视觉任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决针对特定高精度任务的AI模型在多模块任务应用中的低效率问题。

Method: 本研究采用编码器-解码器框架，学习可变形、可泛化的表示，支持多个下游AI模块共享特征空间。

Result: 验证了NS可以有效执行成像和视觉模块任务，如去马赛克、去噪、深度估计和语义分割。

Conclusion: 本文提出的通用神经空间（NS）架构通过预计算特征，优化了多任务视觉处理，减少冗余并提高跨域泛化能力，适用于广泛的硬件。

Abstract: The majority of AI models in imaging and vision are customized to perform on
specific high-precision task. However, this strategy is inefficient for
applications with a series of modular tasks, since each requires a mapping into
a disparate latent domain. To address this inefficiency, we proposed a
universal Neural Space (NS), where an encoder-decoder framework pre-computes
features across vision and imaging tasks. Our encoder learns transformation
aware, generalizable representations, which enable multiple downstream AI
modules to share the same feature space. This architecture reduces redundancy,
improves generalization across domain shift, and establishes a foundation for
effecient multi-task vision pipelines. Furthermore, as opposed to larger
transformer backbones, our backbone is lightweight and CNN-based, allowing for
wider across hardware. We furthur demonstrate that imaging and vision modules,
such as demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation and semantic segmentation can
be performed efficiently in the NS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对边缘设备在复杂环境中不断变化需要定期更新模型的问题。

Method: 提出了一种选择有用图像的方法，以最大化模型质量并降低传输成本。

Result: 相似训练负载下，结合高置信度流式策略和多样性方法可获得高质量模型。

Conclusion: 高置信度的流式策略与基于多样性的结合可以在最低的数据集查询下，生成高质量的模型。

Abstract: Edge camera-based systems are continuously expanding, facing ever-evolving
environments that require regular model updates. In practice, complex teacher
models are run on a central server to annotate data, which is then used to
train smaller models tailored to the edge devices with limited computational
power. This work explores how to select the most useful images for training to
maximize model quality while keeping transmission costs low. Our work shows
that, for a similar training load (i.e., iterations), a high-confidence
stream-based strategy coupled with a diversity-based approach produces a
high-quality model with minimal dataset queries.

### [8] [InstructVTON: Optimal Auto-Masking and Natural-Language-Guided Interactive Style Control for Inpainting-Based Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20524)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructVTON是一种基于自然语言的交互式虚拟试穿系统，通过自动生成遮罩和多轮图像生成简化用户体验，实现复杂风格控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统遮罩方法在控制结果布局时的困难，使用户能够更轻松地进行虚拟试穿。

Method: 利用图像引导或图像条件的修复任务，将虚拟试穿问题建模，同时结合视觉语言模型(VLMs)和图像分割模型。

Result: InstructVTON能够与现有虚拟试穿模型互操作，并在风格控制方面实现最先进的结果。

Conclusion: InstructVTON通过自动化二进制遮罩生成和图像生成的多个回合简化了用户体验，实现了更复杂的风格控制，达到最先进的结果。

Abstract: We present InstructVTON, an instruction-following interactive virtual try-on
system that allows fine-grained and complex styling control of the resulting
generation, guided by natural language, on single or multiple garments. A
computationally efficient and scalable formulation of virtual try-on formulates
the problem as an image-guided or image-conditioned inpainting task. These
inpainting-based virtual try-on models commonly use a binary mask to control
the generation layout. Producing a mask that yields desirable result is
difficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some
cases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve
shirt with "sleeves rolled up" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt
with sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve).
InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation
models for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on
user-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies
the end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask,
and by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on
scenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models
alone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on
models to achieve state-of-the-art results with styling control.

TL;DR: DeepAFRNet是一种有效的深度学习模型，针对修改指纹的识别表现优越，强调阈值选择对准确率的影响，并适合实际应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的生物识别系统面对故意修改的指纹（AFR）时存在挑战，因此需要一个鲁棒的识别模型。

Method: DeepAFRNet使用VGG16骨干网络提取高维特征，并通过余弦相似度比较嵌入。

Result: 在SOCOFing Real-Altered子集上，DeepAFRNet在不同难度级别下分别取得了96.7%、98.76%和99.54%的准确率。

Conclusion: DeepAFRNet在处理经修改的指纹识别方面表现出色，显示出在生物识别系统中选择合适阈值的重要性，并且适用于现实世界的安全需求。

Abstract: Altered fingerprint recognition (AFR) is challenging for biometric
verification in applications such as border control, forensics, and fiscal
admission. Adversaries can deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade
detection, so robust recognition of altered prints is essential. We present
DeepAFRNet, a deep learning recognition model that matches and recognizes
distorted fingerprint samples. The approach uses a VGG16 backbone to extract
high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings. We
evaluate on the SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels
(Easy, Medium, Hard). With strict thresholds, DeepAFRNet achieves accuracies of
96.7 percent, 98.76 percent, and 99.54 percent for the three levels. A
threshold-sensitivity study shows that relaxing the threshold from 0.92 to 0.72
sharply degrades accuracy to 7.86 percent, 27.05 percent, and 29.51 percent,
underscoring the importance of threshold selection in biometric systems. By
using real altered samples and reporting per-level metrics, DeepAFRNet
addresses limitations of prior work based on synthetic alterations or limited
verification protocols, and indicates readiness for real-world deployments
where both security and recognition resilience are critical.

Method: 通过从预训练的Vision Transformer模型DINOv2中提取注意力图，并将其转化为3D体素网格，以增强行为克隆策略。

Result: 在RLBench双手基准测试中，所提方法在各项任务上实现了8.2%的绝对提高和21.9%的相对提升。

Conclusion: 我们的注意力引导特征提取显著提升了双手机器人操作任务的表现，平均绝对提升了8.2%。

Abstract: We investigate the integration of attention maps from a pre-trained Vision
Transformer into voxel representations to enhance bimanual robotic
manipulation. Specifically, we extract attention maps from DINOv2, a
self-supervised ViT model, and interpret them as pixel-level saliency scores
over RGB images. These maps are lifted into a 3D voxel grid, resulting in
voxel-level semantic cues that are incorporated into a behavior cloning policy.
When integrated into a state-of-the-art voxel-based policy, our
attention-guided featurization yields an average absolute improvement of 8.2%
and a relative gain of 21.9% across all tasks in the RLBench bimanual
benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于蓝莓检测受到环境变化的挑战，研究目的在于寻求深度学习对象检测器能够在实际场景中实现有效的准确性、速度和内存权衡，同时需要一个多样化的大规模数据集。

Method: 通过对36种模型变体进行比较分析，评估了它们在新创建的蓝莓检测数据集上的表现，并应用了基于无偏均值教师的半监督学习来提升检测性能。

Result: 数据集包含661幅树冠图像和85,879个标记样本，其中成熟和未成熟的蓝莓在不同光照和遮挡条件下进行了标注。经过比较，YOLOv12m和RT-DETRv2-X分别取得了93.3%和93.6%的mAP@50，之后通过半监督学习进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: 这项研究表明，YOLOv12m和RT-DETRv2-X在蓝莓检测中表现最佳，特别是经过半监督学习后，RT-DETR-v2-X达到了94.8%的最佳mAP@50。

Abstract: Blueberry detection in natural environments remains challenging due to
variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur due to environmental factors and
imaging devices. Deep learning-based object detectors promise to address these
challenges, but they demand a large-scale, diverse dataset that captures the
real-world complexities. Moreover, deploying these models in practical
scenarios often requires the right accuracy/speed/memory trade-off in model
selection. This study presents a novel comparative benchmark analysis of
advanced real-time object detectors, including YOLO (You Only Look Once)
(v8-v12) and RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformers) (v1-v2) families,
consisting of 36 model variants, evaluated on a newly curated dataset for
blueberry detection. This dataset comprises 661 canopy images collected with
smartphones during the 2022-2023 seasons, consisting of 85,879 labelled
instances (including 36,256 ripe and 49,623 unripe blueberries) across a wide
range of lighting conditions, occlusions, and fruit maturity stages. Among the
YOLO models, YOLOv12m achieved the best accuracy with a mAP@50 of 93.3%, while
RT-DETRv2-X obtained a mAP@50 of 93.6%, the highest among all the RT-DETR
variants. The inference time varied with the model scale and complexity, and
the mid-sized models appeared to offer a good accuracy-speed balance. To
further enhance detection performance, all the models were fine-tuned using
Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) on a separate set of
1,035 unlabeled images acquired by a ground-based machine vision platform in
2024. This resulted in accuracy gains ranging from -1.4% to 2.9%, with
RT-DETR-v2-X achieving the best mAP@50 of 94.8%. More in-depth research into
SSL is needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data. Both the dataset
and software programs of this study are made publicly available to support
further research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的ROI增强策略，以提升乳腺X光图像分类，结果表明在不增加额外标签或更改模型架构的情况下，该策略能改善分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 响应于乳腺癌筛查中深度学习应用的限制，如低分辨率数据集和小样本量，寻求提高模型性能的方法。

Method: 提出一种轻量级的区域兴趣（ROI）增强策略，使用随机剪裁替代全图像进行训练。

Result: 在Mini-DDSM数据集上，ROI增强带来了适度的ROC-AUC增益，但PR-AUC结果变化不大。

Conclusion: 简单的数据驱动ROI策略可以在受限环境中提高乳房X光分类，而无需额外标签或架构修改。

Abstract: Breast cancer screening with mammography remains central to early detection
and mortality reduction. Deep learning has shown strong potential for
automating mammogram interpretation, yet limited-resolution datasets and small
sample sizes continue to restrict performance. We revisit the Mini-DDSM dataset
(9,684 images; 2,414 patients) and introduce a lightweight region-of-interest
(ROI) augmentation strategy. During training, full images are probabilistically
replaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free
bounding-box bank, with optional jitter to increase variability. We evaluate
under strict patient-level cross-validation and report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and
training-time efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory). Because ROI
augmentation is training-only, inference-time cost remains unchanged. On
Mini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest
average ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to
slightly lower. These results demonstrate that simple, data-centric ROI
strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings
without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.

*Jing Wu,Zirui Wang,Iro Laina,Victor Adrian Prisacariu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种通过镜面反射进行3D重建的方法，能够从单图像生成虚拟视图，并有效处理动态场景，验证了方法在真实及合成数据上的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用镜子反射的特性，提取图像中的立体信息，简化成像过程，实现从单图像到多视图立体的转化。

Method: 我们设计了一种转换，构建出一个物理有效的虚拟摄像头，并引入对称感知损失来优化姿态估计。

Result: 实验表明，我们的方法在真实和合成数据上具有有效性，能够实现可靠的3D重建。

Conclusion: 我们提出了一种利用镜面反射进行三维重建的方法，能够从单张图像中生成虚拟视图，并且有效处理动态场景的每一帧。

Abstract: Mirror reflections are common in everyday environments and can provide stereo
information within a single capture, as the real and reflected virtual views
are visible simultaneously. We exploit this property by treating the reflection
as an auxiliary view and designing a transformation that constructs a
physically valid virtual camera, allowing direct pixel-domain generation of the
virtual view while adhering to the real-world imaging process. This enables a
multi-view stereo setup from a single image, simplifying the imaging process,
making it compatible with powerful feed-forward reconstruction models for
generalizable and robust 3D reconstruction. To further exploit the geometric
symmetry introduced by mirrors, we propose a symmetric-aware loss to refine
pose estimation. Our framework also naturally extends to dynamic scenes, where
each frame contains a mirror reflection, enabling efficient per-frame geometry
recovery. For quantitative evaluation, we provide a fully customizable
synthetic dataset of 16 Blender scenes, each with ground-truth point clouds and
camera poses. Extensive experiments on real-world data and synthetic data are
conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: 本研究提出 FacadeTrack 框架，通过街景图像评估灾后建筑居住状况，显著提高了决策精度，并推动了应急管理的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在灾后评估建筑物的居住情况对资源分配和重建至关重要，现有技术在获取必要信息方面存在局限性。

Method: 使用街景图像和全景视频，结合语言指导，链接到地块并纠正视角，提取可解释属性以支持决策策略。

Result: 两阶段方案在 Hurricane Helene 后的评估中取得了更高的 F-1 分数，显示出改进的精度和召回率，而中间属性和空间诊断有助于识别和改善残余错误。

Conclusion: FacadeTrack 提供了一种审计性和可扩展的建筑居住评估方法，适合融入地理空间和应急管理工作流程。

Abstract: Building-level occupancy after disasters is vital for triage, inspections,
utility re-energization, and equitable resource allocation. Overhead imagery
provides rapid coverage but often misses facade and access cues that determine
habitability, while street-view imagery captures those details but is sparse
and difficult to align with parcels. We present FacadeTrack, a street-level,
language-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies
views to facades, and elicits interpretable attributes (for example, entry
blockage, temporary coverings, localized debris) that drive two decision
strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design that separates
perception from conservative reasoning. Evaluated across two post-Hurricane
Helene surveys, the two-stage approach achieves a precision of 0.927, a recall
of 0.781, and an F-1 score of 0.848, compared with the one-stage baseline at a
precision of 0.943, a recall of 0.728, and an F-1 score of 0.822. Beyond
accuracy, intermediate attributes and spatial diagnostics reveal where and why
residual errors occur, enabling targeted quality control. The pipeline provides
auditable, scalable occupancy assessments suitable for integration into
geospatial and emergency-management workflows.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨人类在补充视觉特征时使用的语义表征，而非仅仅关注视觉特征。

Method: 通过两项研究，第一项直接询问参与者对动画移动形状的印象，第二项通过相似性判断测量社交互动的表征几何，并与基于视觉特征、标签和动画描述的语义嵌入的模型预测进行比较。

Result: 语义模型提供了补充视觉特征的信息，尤其是基于动词的嵌入对解释人类相似性判断的表现最佳。

Conclusion: 在简单的动态展示中，社交感知反映了社交互动的语义结构，连接了视觉与抽象表现形式。

Abstract: Humans are social creatures who readily recognize various social interactions
from simple display of moving shapes. While previous research has often focused
on visual features, we examine what semantic representations that humans employ
to complement visual features. In Study 1, we directly asked human participants
to label the animations based on their impression of moving shapes. We found
that human responses were distributed. In Study 2, we measured the
representational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity
judgments and compared it with model predictions based on visual features,
labels, and semantic embeddings from animation descriptions. We found that
semantic models provided complementary information to visual features in
explaining human judgments. Among the semantic models, verb-based embeddings
extracted from descriptions account for human similarity judgments the best.
These results suggest that social perception in simple displays reflects the
semantic structure of social interactions, bridging visual and abstract
representations.

Motivation: 解决现有跨视图地理定位方法在严重外观变化和可靠性匹配方面的挑战，以提高跨领域的泛化能力。

Method: 提出EGS框架，结合E(2)-Steerable CNN编码器和虚拟超节点图，旨在增强特征稳定性和全局-局部一致性。

Result: 在University-1652和SUES-200基准测试上，EGS框架表现出显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: EGS框架显著提升了跨领域的图像地理定位性能，建立了新的技术领先水平。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) aims to match images of the same location
captured from drastically different viewpoints. Despite recent progress,
existing methods still face two key challenges: (1) achieving robustness under
severe appearance variations induced by diverse UAV orientations and fields of
view, which hinders cross-domain generalization, and (2) establishing reliable
correspondences that capture both global scene-level semantics and fine-grained
local details. In this paper, we propose EGS, a novel CVGL framework designed
to enhance cross-domain generalization. Specifically, we introduce an
E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder to extract stable and reliable features under
rotation and viewpoint shifts. Furthermore, we construct a graph with a virtual
super-node that connects to all local nodes, enabling global semantics to be
aggregated and redistributed to local regions, thereby enforcing global-local
consistency. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200
benchmarks demonstrate that EGS consistently achieves substantial performance
gains and establishes a new state of the art in cross-domain CVGL.

Conclusion: 本研究提出的双通道边缘网络有效结合了结构语义和边缘细化，为红外小目标检测和定位提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection is crucial for remote sensing applications
like disaster warning and maritime surveillance. However, due to the lack of
distinctive texture and morphological features, infrared small targets are
highly susceptible to blending into cluttered and noisy backgrounds. A
fundamental challenge in designing deep models for this task lies in the
inherent conflict between capturing high-resolution spatial details for minute
targets and extracting robust semantic context for larger targets, often
leading to feature misalignment and suboptimal performance. Existing methods
often rely on fixed gradient operators or simplistic attention mechanisms,
which are inadequate for accurately extracting target edges under low contrast
and high noise. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Path Edge Network that
explicitly addresses this challenge by decoupling edge enhancement and semantic
modeling into two complementary processing paths. The first path employs a
Bidirectional Interaction Module, which uses both Local Self-Attention and
Global Self-Attention to capture multi-scale local and global feature
dependencies. The global attention mechanism, based on a Transformer
architecture, integrates long-range semantic relationships and contextual
information, ensuring robust scene understanding. The second path introduces
the Multi-Edge Refiner, which enhances fine-grained edge details using cascaded
Taylor finite difference operators at multiple scales. This mathematical
approach, along with an attention-driven gating mechanism, enables precise edge
localization and feature enhancement for targets of varying sizes, while
effectively suppressing noise. Our method provides a promising solution for
precise infrared small target detection and localization, combining structural
semantics and edge refinement in a unified framework.

Abstract: Intention recognition has traditionally focused on individual intentions,
overlooking the complexities of collective intentions in group settings. To
address this limitation, we introduce the concept of group intention, which
represents shared goals emerging through the actions of multiple individuals,
and Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), a novel task that forecasts when group
intentions will occur by analyzing individual actions and interactions before
the collective goal becomes apparent. To investigate GIF in a specific
scenario, we propose SHOT, the first large-scale dataset for GIF, consisting of
1,979 basketball video clips captured from 5 camera views and annotated with 6
types of individual attributes. SHOT is designed with 3 key characteristics:
multi-individual information, multi-view adaptability, and multi-level
intention, making it well-suited for studying emerging group intentions.
Furthermore, we introduce GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that
extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to
forecast intention emergence. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of
SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group
intention forecasting. The dataset is available at

Motivation: 应对海洋物体检测中的数据注释稀缺和模型泛化能力差的挑战，特别是在开放海洋环境下的表现不足。

Method: 提出了一种以数据为中心的生成选择框架，结合合成数据生成和基于任务的样本选择。

Conclusion: Neptune-X在海洋场景合成方面设立了新的基准，显著提高了检测准确性，尤其是在具有挑战性的未充分代表的场景中。

Abstract: Maritime object detection is essential for navigation safety, surveillance,
and autonomous operations, yet constrained by two key challenges: the scarcity
of annotated maritime data and poor generalization across various maritime
attributes (e.g., object category, viewpoint, location, and imaging
environment). % In particular, models trained on existing datasets often
underperform in underrepresented scenarios such as open-sea environments. To
address these challenges, we propose Neptune-X, a data-centric
generative-selection framework that enhances training effectiveness by
leveraging synthetic data generation with task-aware sample selection. From the
generation perspective, we develop X-to-Maritime, a multi-modality-conditioned
generative model that synthesizes diverse and realistic maritime scenes. A key
component is the Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module, which captures
boundary interactions between objects and their aquatic surroundings to improve
visual fidelity. To further improve downstream tasking performance, we propose
Attribute-correlated Active Sampling, which dynamically selects synthetic
samples based on their task relevance. To support robust benchmarking, we
construct the Maritime Generation Dataset, the first dataset tailored for
generative maritime learning, encompassing a wide range of semantic conditions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark in
maritime scene synthesis, significantly improving detection accuracy,
particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.The code

Motivation: 针对长时间的月球制图任务，CVA在姿态估计中的难点为研究动机。

Method: STELLA结合了基于Mask R-CNN的火山口检测器、无描述的火山口识别模块、稳健的透视-n-火山口姿态求解器和批量轨道确定后端。

Result: STELLA在各类视角、光照条件和月球纬度下显示出米级位置精度和亚度的姿态精度。

Conclusion: STELLA展示了在真实月球制图环境下进行CBN的有效性，提供了对未来任务的操作条件的见解。

Abstract: Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) uses the ubiquitous impact craters of the Moon
observed on images as natural landmarks to determine the six degrees of freedom
pose of a spacecraft. To date, CBN has primarily been studied in the context of
powered descent and landing. These missions are typically short in duration,
with high-frequency imagery captured from a nadir viewpoint over well-lit
terrain. In contrast, lunar mapping missions involve sparse, oblique imagery
acquired under varying illumination conditions over potentially year-long
campaigns, posing significantly greater challenges for pose estimation. We
bridge this gap with STELLA - the first end-to-end CBN pipeline for
long-duration lunar mapping. STELLA combines a Mask R-CNN-based crater
detector, a descriptor-less crater identification module, a robust
perspective-n-crater pose solver, and a batch orbit determination back-end. To
rigorously test STELLA, we introduce CRESENT-365 - the first public dataset
that emulates a year-long lunar mapping mission. Each of its 15,283 images is
rendered from high-resolution digital elevation models with SPICE-derived Sun
angles and Moon motion, delivering realistic global coverage, illumination
cycles, and viewing geometries. Experiments on CRESENT+ and CRESENT-365 show
that STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude
accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination
conditions, and lunar latitudes. These results constitute the first
comprehensive assessment of CBN in a true lunar mapping setting and inform
operational conditions that should be considered for future missions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，深度视觉和语言模型在中后层存在语义对齐，且这种对齐通过示例聚合得到增强，反映了与人类偏好的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度视觉模型和语言模型在不同模态上训练，但它们的输入在某种程度上投影到一个对齐的表征空间中，缺乏对这种对齐特征的深入理解。

Method: 通过系统地调查不同模型中对齐出现的位置、支持对齐的视觉或语言线索，以及多个示例对对齐的影响。

Result: 对齐在两种模型类型的中后层达到峰值，表明从特定模态到概念共享的表征发生了转变。对齐对外观变化具有鲁棒性，但在语义改变时（例如，物体移除或词序打乱）会崩溃。多个描述对应于同一图像时，模型能够捕捉到与人类判断相似的细微语义区别。

Conclusion: 单模态网络趋向于一个与人类判断一致的共享语义代码，并且通过示例聚合来增强对齐。

Abstract: Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained
on disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially
aligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in
each network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support
it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios,
and how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we
systematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in
mid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from
modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is
robust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered
(e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared
code is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a
forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task shows that human preferences for image-caption
matches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model
pairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to
a single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic
distinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across
exemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our
results demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code
that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation.

Motivation: 解决现有图像编辑方法在个性化图像合成任务中面临的几何控制不足、风格一致性差以及缺乏训练的问题。

Method: 通过将2D对象转换为3D并在3D层面进行交互编辑，然后从指定视角重新渲染为2D图像。

Result: 成功实现了具有几何控制和风格一致性的编辑图像。

Conclusion: 提出了一种名为 FreeInsert 的新框架，可以无训练地将对象插入任意场景，实现几何控制与风格一致性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant progress in image
generation, allowing for effortless customized generation. However, existing
image editing methods still face certain limitations when dealing with
personalized image composition tasks. First, there is the issue of lack of
geometric control over the inserted objects. Current methods are confined to 2D
space and typically rely on textual instructions, making it challenging to
maintain precise geometric control over the objects. Second, there is the
challenge of style consistency. Existing methods often overlook the style
consistency between the inserted object and the background, resulting in a lack
of realism. In addition, the challenge of inserting objects into images without
extensive training remains significant. To address these issues, we propose
\textit{FreeInsert}, a novel training-free framework that customizes object
insertion into arbitrary scenes by leveraging 3D geometric information.
Benefiting from the advances in existing 3D generation models, we first convert
the 2D object into 3D, perform interactive editing at the 3D level, and then
re-render it into a 2D image from a specified view. This process introduces
geometric controls such as shape or view. The rendered image, serving as
geometric control, is combined with style and content control achieved through
diffusion adapters, ultimately producing geometrically controlled,
style-consistent edited images via the diffusion model.

Conclusion: CustomEnhancer是一个新的框架，能够有效增强个性化模型的能力，提供高效的生成和控制，并在多样性和身份保真度上达到最新成果。

Abstract: Recently remarkable progress has been made in synthesizing realistic human
photos using text-to-image diffusion models. However, current approaches face
degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity. We
introduce CustomEnhancer, a novel framework to augment existing identity
customization models. CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement pipeline that
leverages face swapping techniques, pretrained diffusion model, to obtain
additional representations in a zeroshot manner for encoding into personalized
models. Through our proposed triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach, which
identifies and combines two compatible counter-directional latent spaces to
manipulate a pivotal space of personalized model, we unify the generation and
reconstruction processes, realizing generation from three flows. Our pipeline
also enables comprehensive training-free control over the generation process of
personalized models, offering precise controlled personalization for them and
eliminating the need for controller retraining for per-model. Besides, to
address the high time complexity of null-text inversion (NTI), we introduce
ResInversion, a novel inversion method that performs noise rectification via a
pre-diffusion mechanism, reducing the inversion time by 129 times. Experiments
demonstrate that CustomEnhancer reach SOTA results at scene diversity, identity
fidelity, training-free controls, while also showing the efficiency of our
ResInversion over NTI. The code will be made publicly available upon paper
acceptance.

task accuracy in the context of two different inference scenarios: "remote" and
"split" inferencing. Our study showcases various use cases of the evaluation
platform incorporated with standard codecs (under development) by examining the
compression gain on several datasets in terms of bit-rate versus task accuracy.
This evaluation platform has been developed as open-source software and is

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) in medical image segmentation
offers a promising solution for generalizing to unseen domains during testing,
addressing domain shift challenges and minimizing annotation costs. However,
conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for
each source domain in the training set, a condition that is not always met in
practice. The coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift in the
training set is a prevalent issue. Thus, this paper explores a more practical
and challenging scenario, cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization
(CD-SSDG), where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training
data, in addition to shifts between training and testing sets. Existing SSDG
methods exhibit sub-optimal performance under such domain shifts because of
inaccurate pseudolabels. To address this issue, we propose a novel
dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework tailored for CD-SSDG.
Building upon the co-training paradigm with two sub-models offering cross
pseudo supervision, our DAC framework integrates extra feature-level
supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks for each sub-model. This
feature-level supervision serves to address inaccurate pseudo supervision
caused by domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing
complementary supervision from the rich feature space. Additionally, two
distinct auxiliary self-supervised tasks are integrated into each sub-model to
enhance domain-invariant discriminative feature learning and prevent model
collapse. Extensive experiments on real-world medical image segmentation
datasets, i.e., Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM, demonstrate the robust
generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.

Motivation: 为了解决实时目标检测框架中性能和资源的挑战，DEIMv2旨在优化检测能力和计算效率。

Method: 通过引入DINOv3特征及空间调优适配器，开发了八种不同规模的模型，同时采用轻量化的HGNetv2并进行深度与宽度剪枝。

Result: DEIMv2在多个规模下实现了优越的AP值，如DEIMv2-X以50.3百万参数获得57.8 AP，DEIMv2-S以9.71百万参数首次超过50 AP，DEIMv2-Pico以1.5百万参数实现38.5 AP。

Conclusion: DEIMv2在多种场景下实现了卓越的性能与成本平衡，取得了新的最先进结果。

Abstract: Benefiting from the simplicity and effectiveness of Dense O2O and MAL, DEIM
has become the mainstream training framework for real-time DETRs, significantly
outperforming the YOLO series. In this work, we extend it with DINOv3 features,
resulting in DEIMv2. DEIMv2 spans eight model sizes from X to Atto, covering
GPU, edge, and mobile deployment. For the X, L, M, and S variants, we adopt
DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones and introduce a Spatial Tuning Adapter
(STA), which efficiently converts DINOv3's single-scale output into multi-scale
features and complements strong semantics with fine-grained details to enhance
detection. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, and Atto), we
employ HGNetv2 with depth and width pruning to meet strict resource budgets.
Together with a simplified decoder and an upgraded Dense O2O, this unified
design enables DEIMv2 to achieve a superior performance-cost trade-off across
diverse scenarios, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Notably, our
largest model, DEIMv2-X, achieves 57.8 AP with only 50.3 million parameters,
surpassing prior X-scale models that require over 60 million parameters for
just 56.5 AP. On the compact side, DEIMv2-S is the first sub-10 million model
(9.71 million) to exceed the 50 AP milestone on COCO, reaching 50.9 AP. Even
the ultra-lightweight DEIMv2-Pico, with just 1.5 million parameters, delivers
38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3 million) with around 50 percent fewer
parameters.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在自动驾驶、医学诊断和内容审核等关键应用中至关重要，但现有模型对对抗攻击仍然脆弱，亟需提升安全性。

Method: 提出了一种名为动态对抗课程DAC-LoRA的新框架，将对抗训练集成到参数高效微调中，基于逐步挑战的智能课程进行训练。

Result: 通过采用第一阶静止条件(FOSC)和TRADES启发式损失，DAC-LoRA在对抗鲁棒性上取得显著提升，同时对清晰准确率影响不大。

Conclusion: DAC-LoRA框架能够有效提升视觉语言模型的对抗鲁棒性，同时保持良好的清晰准确率，并可与标准的参数高效微调流程轻松集成。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are foundational to critical applications like
autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and content moderation. While
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient
adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for
numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can
cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. We propose Dynamic Adversarial
Curriculum DAC-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates adversarial training
into PEFT. The core principle of our method i.e. an intelligent curriculum of
progressively challenging attack, is general and can potentially be applied to
any iterative attack method. Guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition
(FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements
in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy.
Our work presents an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable method to
demonstrate that the DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into a
standard PEFT pipeline to significantly enhance robustness.

Abstract: Prompt learning has become an efficient paradigm for adapting CLIP to
downstream tasks. Compared with traditional fine-tuning, prompt learning
optimizes a few parameters yet yields highly competitive results, especially
appealing in federated learning for computational efficiency. engendering
domain shift among clients and posing a formidable challenge for
downstream-task adaptation. Existing federated domain generalization (FDG)
methods based on prompt learning typically learn soft prompts from training
samples, replacing manually designed prompts to enhance the generalization
ability of federated models. However, these learned prompts exhibit limited
diversity and tend to ignore information from unknown domains. We propose a
novel and effective method from a generative perspective for handling FDG
tasks, namely federated domain generalization with domain-specific soft prompts
generation (FedDSPG). Specifically, during training, we introduce
domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain and integrate content and
domain knowledge into the generative model among clients. In the inference
phase, the generator is utilized to obtain DSPs for unseen target domains, thus
guiding downstream tasks in unknown domains. Comprehensive evaluations across
several public datasets confirm that our method outperforms existing strong
baselines in FDG, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Low back pain affects millions worldwide, driving the need for robust
diagnostic models that can jointly analyze complex medical images and
accompanying text reports. We present LumbarCLIP, a novel multimodal framework
that leverages contrastive language-image pretraining to align lumbar spine MRI
scans with corresponding radiological descriptions. Built upon a curated
dataset containing axial MRI views paired with expert-written reports,
LumbarCLIP integrates vision encoders (ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Swin
Transformer) with a BERT-based text encoder to extract dense representations.
These are projected into a shared embedding space via learnable projection
heads, configurable as linear or non-linear, and normalized to facilitate
stable contrastive training using a soft CLIP loss. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on downstream classification, reaching up to
95.00% accuracy and 94.75% F1-score on the test set, despite inherent class
imbalance. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate that linear projection heads
yield more effective cross-modal alignment than non-linear variants. LumbarCLIP
offers a promising foundation for automated musculoskeletal diagnosis and
clinical decision support.

TL;DR: PoisonVID是首个针对VideoLLM中prompt引导采样的黑箱攻击，其优化策略显著降低帧相关性，安全性研究至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补prompt引导采样的安全性研究空白，鉴别其潜在的脆弱性。

Method: 通过闭环优化策略持续优化普遍扰动，抑制有害帧相关性评分。

Result: 在三个高级VideoLLM上对三种不同的prompt引导采样策略进行全面评估，PoisonVID实现了82% - 99%的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: PoisonVID展示了prompt引导采样机制的脆弱性，强调了开发更先进采样策略的必要性。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
understanding videos, supporting tasks such as summarization, captioning, and
question answering. Their performance has been driven by advances in frame
sampling, progressing from uniform-based to semantic-similarity-based and, most
recently, prompt-guided strategies. While vulnerabilities have been identified
in earlier sampling strategies, the safety of prompt-guided sampling remains
unexplored. We close this gap by presenting PoisonVID, the first black-box
poisoning attack that undermines prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs. PoisonVID
compromises the underlying prompt-guided sampling mechanism through a
closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal
perturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction
set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions leveraging a shadow
VideoLLM and a lightweight language model, i.e., GPT-4o-mini. Comprehensively
evaluated on three prompt-guided sampling strategies and across three advanced
VideoLLMs, PoisonVID achieves 82% - 99% attack success rate, highlighting the
importance of developing future advanced sampling strategies for VideoLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有的QAT-KD方法在低比特量化下难以平衡任务特定和蒸馏损失的问题，尤其是由于梯度幅度不均。

Method: 提出了一种新的可学习正则化方法GoR，通过使用两个可训练参数自适应地平衡任务特定损失和知识蒸馏损失。

Result: GoR在图像分类、目标检测和大型语言模型压缩实验中表现优于现有最先进的QAT-KD方法。

Conclusion: EKD-GoR在实际部署中提供了一种强健的解决方案，能够在低功耗边缘设备上以更快的推理速度维持全精度的准确率。

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) combined with knowledge distillation (KD)
is a promising strategy for compressing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for
deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, existing QAT-KD methods
often struggle to balance task-specific (TS) and distillation losses due to
heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization. We
propose Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that
adaptively balances TS and KD objectives using only two trainable parameters
for dynamic loss weighting. GoR reduces conflict between supervision signals,
improves convergence, and boosts the performance of small quantized models
(SQMs). Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large
language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster
inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. We also introduce
QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework that uses multiple
heterogeneous teacher models. Under optimal conditions, the proposed EKD-GoR
can outperform full-precision models, providing a robust solution for
real-world deployment.

Motivation: 尽管在植物种类识别领域取得了进展，许多植物种类仍未被很好的图像化，因此有必要探索利用网络资源来提升植物识别的准确性。

Method: 使用来自Pl@ntNet移动应用程序的第三方测试数据集，对比分析通过网络收集的噪声训练数据集与专业验证的训练数据集的性能。

Conclusion: 这项研究表明，通过网络收集的不可靠大数据集能够与经过专家验证的小型可靠数据集竞争，从而推动植物识别系统的发展。

Abstract: The 2017-th edition of the LifeCLEF plant identification challenge is an
important milestone towards automated plant identification systems working at
the scale of continental floras with 10.000 plant species living mainly in
Europe and North America illustrated by a total of 1.1M images. Nowadays, such
ambitious systems are enabled thanks to the conjunction of the dazzling recent
progress in image classification with deep learning and several outstanding
international initiatives, such as the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), aggregating
the visual knowledge on plant species coming from the main national botany
institutes. However, despite all these efforts the majority of the plant
species still remain without pictures or are poorly illustrated. Outside the
institutional channels, a much larger number of plant pictures are available
and spread on the web through botanist blogs, plant lovers web-pages, image
hosting websites and on-line plant retailers. The LifeCLEF 2017 plant challenge
presented in this paper aimed at evaluating to what extent a large noisy
training dataset collected through the web and containing a lot of labelling
errors can compete with a smaller but trusted training dataset checked by
experts. To fairly compare both training strategies, the test dataset was
created from a third data source, i.e. the Pl@ntNet mobile application that
collects millions of plant image queries all over the world. This paper
presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge,
summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research
groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 植物计数对农业有重要意义，但现有的方法无法覆盖所有植物物种，因此需要重新思考植物计数的问题构建。

Method: 通过引入多分支盒子感知局部计数器，结合视觉变换器以及提取与匹配的理论，提出了TasselNetV4模型。

Result: 在PAC-105和PAC-Somalia数据集上的实验表明，TasselNetV4在计数性能和效率上均优于目前最先进的CAC模型。

Conclusion: TasselNetV4作为一种视觉基础模型，能够有效地进行跨场景、跨尺度和跨物种的植物计数。

Abstract: Accurate plant counting provides valuable information for agriculture such as
crop yield prediction, plant density assessment, and phenotype quantification.
Vision-based approaches are currently the mainstream solution. Prior art
typically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant.
However, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each
year. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent
counting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision,
we argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting,
from what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily
objects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with
time and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than
counting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and
open-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we
inherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new
extension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to
cross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of
TasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC. It builds upon a plain
vision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters
used to enhance cross-scale robustness. Two challenging datasets, PAC-105 and
PAC-Somalia, are harvested. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art CAC
models show that TasselNetV4 achieves not only superior counting performance
but also high efficiency.Our results indicate that TasselNetV4 emerges to be a
vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant
counting.

Motivation: 现有的半监督学习方法在视网膜分割中表现不佳，尤其是在解剖学上不合理的分割、层与病变之间互动建模不足，以及缺乏拓扑正确性的保证等。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的半监督模型，引入了一个完全可微的生物标志物拓扑引擎，以强制执行解剖上正确的病变和层次分割。这种模型实现了层次和病变之间的双向影响联合学习。

Conclusion: 该方法在OCT扫描的病变和层次分割方面优于当前最先进的技术，同时能够将层次分割推广到病理案例，展示了结合解剖约束的半监督学习在准确、稳健且可靠的视网膜生物标志物分割中的潜力。

Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely used for diagnosing and
monitoring retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
The segmentation of biomarkers such as layers and lesions is essential for
patient diagnosis and follow-up. Recently, semi-supervised learning has shown
promise in improving retinal segmentation performance. However, existing
methods often produce anatomically implausible segmentations, fail to
effectively model layer-lesion interactions, and lack guarantees on topological
correctness.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised model that
introduces a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine to enforce
anatomically correct segmentation of lesions and layers. This enables joint
learning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions, leveraging
unlabeled and diverse partially labeled datasets. Our model learns a
disentangled representation, separating spatial and style factors. This
approach enables more realistic layer segmentations and improves lesion
segmentation, while strictly enforcing lesion location in their anatomically
plausible positions relative to the segmented layers.
  We evaluate the proposed model on public and internal datasets of OCT scans
and show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art in both lesion and
layer segmentation, while demonstrating the ability to generalize layer
segmentation to pathological cases using partially annotated training data. Our
results demonstrate the potential of using anatomical constraints in
semi-supervised learning for accurate, robust, and trustworthy retinal
biomarker segmentation.

Abstract: The LifeCLEF plant identification challenge aims at evaluating plant
identification methods and systems at a very large scale, close to the
conditions of a real-world biodiversity monitoring scenario. The 2016-th
edition was actually conducted on a set of more than 110K images illustrating
1000 plant species living in West Europe, built through a large-scale
participatory sensing platform initiated in 2011 and which now involves tens of
thousands of contributors. The main novelty over the previous years is that the
identification task was evaluated as an open-set recognition problem, i.e. a
problem in which the recognition system has to be robust to unknown and never
seen categories. Beyond the brute-force classification across the known classes
of the training set, the big challenge was thus to automatically reject the
false positive classification hits that are caused by the unknown classes. This
overview presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the
challenge, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating
research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的知识基础视觉问答方法因图像字幕中的噪声和语言模型对VQA任务理解不足而受限，因此需要提出一种新方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 通过使用已预训练的视觉语言模型将图像转化为摘要和重新排序的字幕，并生成上下文示例，以此来增强对问题的理解。

Result: SCRA-VQA在OK-VQA和A-OKVQA这两个知识基础视觉问答数据集中表现出色，分别达到了38.8%和34.6%的准确率。

Conclusion: SCRA-VQA显著提升了知识基础视觉问答（KB-VQA）任务的推理能力和适应性，提供了更高的准确率。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality knowledge is a central focus in Knowledge-Based Visual
Question Answering (KB-VQA). Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as
knowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions
as visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the
captions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and
LLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning
capabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank
Augmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to
convert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples
for the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to
exclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to
understand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the
model's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end
training. Based on an LLM with 6.7B parameters, SCRA-VQA performs excellently
on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets: OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, achieving
accuracies of 38.8% and 34.6%. Our code is available at

Motivation: 尽管感知优化中的保真度目标和对抗目标至关重要，但它们作为IQA指标的有效性之间的关系尚未深入研究。

Method: 系统分析感知优化目标与IQA指标的相关性，探索对抗训练下的表现，比较不同判别器架构的效果。

Result: 发现优秀的IQA指标在感知优化中未必有效，且判别器架构影响优化效果，尤其是补丁级和卷积架构比简单和基于Transformer的选择重构更加细致。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了感知优化与图像质量评估（IQA）之间的不对称性，并强调了判别器设计对优化效果的重要影响。

Abstract: Perceptual optimization is primarily driven by the fidelity objective, which
enforces both semantic consistency and overall visual realism, while the
adversarial objective provides complementary refinement by enhancing perceptual
sharpness and fine-grained detail. Despite their central role, the correlation
between their effectiveness as optimization objectives and their capability as
image quality assessment (IQA) metrics remains underexplored. In this work, we
conduct a systematic analysis and reveal an unanticipated asymmetry between
perceptual optimization and assessment: fidelity metrics that excel in IQA are
not necessarily effective for perceptual optimization, with this misalignment
emerging more distinctly under adversarial training. In addition, while
discriminators effectively suppress artifacts during optimization, their
learned representations offer only limited benefits when reused as backbone
initializations for IQA models. Beyond this asymmetry, our findings further
demonstrate that discriminator design plays a decisive role in shaping
optimization, with patch-level and convolutional architectures providing more
faithful detail reconstruction than vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives.
These insights advance the understanding of loss function design and its
connection to IQA transferability, paving the way for more principled
approaches to perceptual optimization.

Conclusion: IOG-VQA模型能够有效处理VQA任务中的对象交互和数据集偏见问题，表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) presents a unique challenge by requiring
models to understand and reason about visual content to answer questions
accurately. Existing VQA models often struggle with biases introduced by the
training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and inadequate
generalization to diverse questions and images. This paper presents a novel
model, IOG-VQA, which integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention and
GAN-Based Debiasing to enhance VQA model performance. The self-attention
mechanism allows our model to capture complex interactions between objects
within an image, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the visual
context. Meanwhile, the GAN-based debiasing framework generates unbiased data
distributions, helping the model to learn more robust and generalizable
features. By leveraging these two components, IOG-VQA effectively combines
visual and textual information to address the inherent biases in VQA datasets.
Extensive experiments on the VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets demonstrate that
our model shows excellent performance compared with the existing methods,
particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions highlighting
the importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases in
advancing VQA tasks. Our code is available at

Result: 在心脏超声去雾的实际医学影像问题上，核扩散方法的去雾性能优于传统的RPCA，特别是在对比度增强和信号保留方面。

Conclusion: 结合基于模型的时间模型和深度生成先验可以提升视频恢复的高保真度。

Abstract: Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that
obscure dynamic content, posing challenges for accurate analysis and
restoration. Robust principal component methods address this by decomposing
data into low-rank and sparse components. Still, the sparsity assumption often
fails to capture the rich variability present in real video data. To overcome
this limitation, a hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling
with diffusion posterior sampling is proposed. The proposed method, Nuclear
Diffusion, is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging problem, namely cardiac
ultrasound dehazing, and demonstrates improved dehazing performance compared to
traditional RPCA concerning contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation
(KS statistic). These results highlight the potential of combining model-based
temporal models with deep generative priors for high-fidelity video
restoration.

Abstract: The increasing realism of synthetic images generated by advanced models such
as VAEs, GANs, and LDMs poses significant challenges for synthetic image
detection. To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced
during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2)
decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local
textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies
(LPD) properties rooted in Markov Random Fields, we reconstruct synthetic
images using neighboring pixel information to expose disruptions in texture
continuity and edge coherence. Building upon LPD, we propose FerretNet, a
lightweight neural network with only 1.1M parameters that delivers efficient
and robust synthetic image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FerretNet, trained exclusively on the 4-class ProGAN dataset, achieves an
average accuracy of 97.1% on an open-world benchmark comprising across 22
generative models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 10.6%.

Conclusion: 概念建模范式可以有效转移到视频数据中，从而在保持竞争性能的同时，更好地理解概念在时间上下文中的贡献。

Abstract: Conceptual models such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have driven
substantial progress in improving interpretability for image classification by
leveraging human-interpretable concepts. However, extending these models from
static images to sequences of images, such as video data, introduces a
significant challenge due to the temporal dependencies inherent in videos,
which are essential for capturing actions and events. In this work, we
introduce MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework), an architectural
design inspired by a transformer that adapts the concept bottleneck framework
for video classification and handles sequences of arbitrary length. Within the
video domain, concepts refer to semantic entities such as objects, attributes,
or higher-level components (e.g., 'bow', 'mount', 'shoot') that reoccur across
time - forming motifs collectively describing and explaining actions. Our
design explicitly enables three complementary perspectives: global concept
importance across the entire video, local concept relevance within specific
windows, and temporal dependencies of a concept over time. Our results
demonstrate that the concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively
transferred to video data, enabling a better understanding of concept
contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: 3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements is
essential for safety-critical surveillance tasks, such as drone-based wildfire
monitoring. Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be
solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the
context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available
computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show
that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple
target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a
drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system
(GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter
can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and
image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle
filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new
tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be
conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image
segmentation model.

*Qinfeng Zhu,Han Li,Liang He,Lei Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SwinMamba是一个新框架，通过局部与全局特征的整合，在遥感图像的语义分割任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了克服现有方法在捕捉局部特征方面的不足，提出一种新颖的框架。

Method: 提出SwinMamba框架，结合局部扫描和全局扫描来提升模型对局部和全局特征的感知。

Result: SwinMamba在LoveDA和ISPRS Potsdam数据集上超越了最新的方法，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: SwinMamba在遥感图像语义分割领域表现优越，显示出其作为一种卓越解决方案的潜力。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is a fundamental task in
computer vision, supporting a wide range of applications such as land use
classification, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, this
task is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene
structures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To
address these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been
proposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the
recently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive
field and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and
effectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning
tends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which
are essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts.
To tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by
the Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning
within shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's
perception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two
stages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details,
while its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader
contextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows
enhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature
integration across the entire image. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and
ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential as a superior solution
for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于包的MIL框架，解决了计算病理学中WSI的特征序列异质性，提高了模型的准确性和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着计算病理学的发展，传统方法在处理长序列和有限监督方面效率低下，因此需要一种新方法来提升模型的训练效果和诊断精度。

Method: 基于包的MIL框架，将多个采样的变长特征序列打包成固定长度，采用带有残差分支的多滑动片监督机制，以及基于注意力的下采样器来减少冗余。

Result: 在PANDA(UNI)数据集上，通过优化数据处理流程，我们的方法使模型的准确率提高了8%，而训练时间仅占12%。

Conclusion: 通过提出基于包的MIL框架，我们能有效处理WSI的特征序列长度变化及其带来的异质性，从而提高了模型准确率并节省了训练时间、减少了冗余。

Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide
images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths
(up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited
supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data
heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training
efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited
supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a
pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature
sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving
data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes
discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with
tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature
loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to
compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these
challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while
using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential
in the era of foundation models. The code is

TL;DR: 本研究提出SimDiff模型，通过在扩散模型中直接融入环境参数，高效生成物理合理的人类动作，并在多种参数组合中具备良好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于现有使用模拟器的运动投影方法计算费用高且无法并行化，推动了对新方法的探索。

Method: 提出了一个基于扩散过程的模拟器约束模型SimDiff，直接在去噪过程中融入环境参数。

Result: SimDiff通过条件化环境参数，避免了推理过程中的重复模拟器调用，实现了高效的物理运动生成，并提供了对不同物理系数的精细控制。

Conclusion: SimDiff模型能高效生成物理上合理的人类动作，并在未知环境参数组合中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Generating physically plausible human motion is crucial for applications such
as character animation and virtual reality. Existing approaches often
incorporate a simulator-based motion projection layer to the diffusion process
to enforce physical plausibility. However, such methods are computationally
expensive due to the sequential nature of the simulator, which prevents
parallelization. We show that simulator-based motion projection can be
interpreted as a form of guidance, either classifier-based or classifier-free,
within the diffusion process. Building on this insight, we propose SimDiff, a
Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model that integrates environment parameters
(e.g., gravity, wind) directly into the denoising process. By conditioning on
these parameters, SimDiff generates physically plausible motions efficiently,
without repeated simulator calls at inference, and also provides fine-grained
control over different physical coefficients. Moreover, SimDiff successfully
generalizes to unseen combinations of environmental parameters, demonstrating
compositional generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究了特定视觉架构对高斯噪声的鲁棒性，识别了设计规则，通过理论分析提供了解释，并提出了实用指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨视觉模型在高斯噪声下的鲁棒性与其架构设计之间的关系，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 对1,174个预训练视觉模型进行了广泛评估，并识别出4种一致的设计模式，分别为较大的stem卷积核、较小的输入分辨率、平均池化以及监督式视觉变压器（ViTs）相较于CLIP ViTs的优势。

Result: 通过实施这些设计规则，取得了最高506个排名改善和21.6%的准确率提升，并提出了理论分析来解释观察到的趋势。

Conclusion: 提出了简单可行的设计规则，以提高视觉模型对高斯噪声的鲁棒性，并为这些设计选择提供了理论分析和因果机制解释。

Abstract: While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on
specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why
certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian
noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design
rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained
vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for
improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input
resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather
than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\%p accuracy
gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings,
converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that
low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically
with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy
roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we
demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion
to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that
grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error
and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the
vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller
normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case
sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing
common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into
interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and
build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more
robust against Gaussian noise.

Motivation: 在复杂动态的手术环境中，SG提供了结构化的关系表示，至关重要。

Method: 通过PRISMA-ScR指导的范围审查，系统地映射SG在外科手术研究中的应用和方法进展。

Result: 分析表明SG研究迅速增长，但发现了关键的数据差距，即内部视角研究几乎完全依赖真实世界的2D视频，而外部视角的4D建模则严重依赖模拟数据。

Conclusion: 手术场景图(SG)正在成熟，成为促进手术安全、高效和培训的智能系统的新语义桥梁。

Abstract: Scene graphs (SGs) provide structured relational representations crucial for
decoding complex, dynamic surgical environments. This PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping
review systematically maps the evolving landscape of SG research in surgery,
charting its applications, methodological advancements, and future directions.
Our analysis reveals rapid growth, yet uncovers a critical 'data divide':
internal-view research (e.g., triplet recognition) almost exclusively uses
real-world 2D video, while external-view 4D modeling relies heavily on
simulated data, exposing a key translational research gap. Methodologically,
the field has advanced from foundational graph neural networks to specialized
foundation models that now significantly outperform generalist large
vision-language models in surgical contexts. This progress has established SGs
as a cornerstone technology for both analysis, such as workflow recognition and
automated safety monitoring, and generative tasks like controllable surgical
simulation. Although challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation
persist, they are actively being addressed through emerging techniques.
Surgical SGs are maturing into an essential semantic bridge, enabling a new
generation of intelligent systems to improve surgical safety, efficiency, and
training.

Abstract: We present an automated vision-based system for defect detection and
classification of laser power meter sensor coatings. Our approach addresses the
critical challenge of identifying coating defects such as thermal damage and
scratches that can compromise laser energy measurement accuracy in medical and
industrial applications. The system employs an unsupervised anomaly detection
framework that trains exclusively on ``good'' sensor images to learn normal
coating distribution patterns, enabling detection of both known and novel
defect types without requiring extensive labeled defect datasets. Our
methodology consists of three key components: (1) a robust preprocessing
pipeline using Laplacian edge detection and K-means clustering to segment the
area of interest, (2) synthetic data augmentation via StyleGAN2, and (3) a
UFlow-based neural network architecture for multi-scale feature extraction and
anomaly map generation. Experimental evaluation on 366 real sensor images
demonstrates $93.8\%$ accuracy on defective samples and $89.3\%$ accuracy on
good samples, with image-level AUROC of 0.957 and pixel-level AUROC of 0.961.
The system provides potential annual cost savings through automated quality
control and processing times of 0.5 seconds per image in on-device
implementation.

Motivation: 随着社交媒体的动态传播，金融顾问内容的传播范围扩大，但从冗长的多模态段（30-40分钟）中提取洞察仍然具有挑战性。

Method: FASTER是一个模块化框架，使用BLIP、OCR和Whisper进行特征提取和文本转录，结合了优化的DPO损失函数和基于排名的检索机制。

Abstract: The dynamic propagation of social media has broadened the reach of financial
advisory content through podcast videos, yet extracting insights from lengthy,
multimodal segments (30-40 minutes) remains challenging. We introduce FASTER
(Financial Advisory Summariser with Textual Embedded Relevant images), a
modular framework that tackles three key challenges: (1) extracting
modality-specific features, (2) producing optimized, concise summaries, and (3)
aligning visual keyframes with associated textual points. FASTER employs BLIP
for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based
transcription with Speaker diarization as BOS features. A modified Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)-based loss function, equipped with BOS-specific
fact-checking, ensures precision, relevance, and factual consistency against
the human-aligned summary. A ranker-based retrieval mechanism further aligns
keyframes with summarized content, enhancing interpretability and cross-modal
coherence. To acknowledge data resource scarcity, we introduce Fin-APT, a
dataset comprising 470 publicly accessible financial advisory pep-talk videos
for robust multimodal research. Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm
FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability when compared to
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By establishing
a new standard for multimodal summarization, FASTER makes financial advisory
content more accessible and actionable, thereby opening new avenues for
research. The dataset and code are available at:

TL;DR: 本文提出的ASD适配器使得深度图像聚类可以在没有预训练的条件下进行，显著提升了聚类性能，并且对现有方法也有提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SSL技术在深度聚类框架中的应用受到预训练和模型依赖的限制，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 提出ASD适配器，通过随机采样伪标签数据与设置实例级分类器，利用语义对齐的实例级标签进行学习，从而获得图像数据的高层相似性并分配聚类级别标签。

Result: ASD在多种基准测试上相较于最新的深度图像聚类方法表现出优秀的性能，与使用真实标签的SSL方法的准确率差距非常小，CIFAR-10仅为1.33%。

Conclusion: ASD可以在没有任何预训练的条件下，实现深度图像聚类的冷启动，并且在各种基准测试中表现优越，且有助于提高现有结合SSL的深度图像聚类方法的性能。

Abstract: Recently, some works integrate SSL techniques into deep clustering frameworks
to enhance image clustering performance. However, they all need pretraining,
clustering learning, or a trained clustering model as prerequisites, limiting
the flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in the image clustering
task. This work introduces ASD, an adaptor that enables the cold-start of SSL
learners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites. Specifically, we
first randomly sample pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data, and set an
instance-level classifier to learn them with semantically aligned
instance-level labels. With the ability of instance-level classification, we
track the class transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract
high-level similarities of instance-level classes, which can be utilized to
assign cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data. Finally, we use the
pseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels to trigger a general SSL
learner trained on the unlabeled data for image clustering. We show the
superior performance of ASD across various benchmarks against the latest deep
image clustering approaches and very slight accuracy gaps compared to SSL
methods using ground-truth, e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10. Moreover, ASD can
also further boost the performance of existing SSL-embedded deep image
clustering methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉变换器模型在知识蒸馏过程中因高效应伪影导致的信息信号损失问题。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的蒸馏框架，称为SiNGER，通过使用nullspace-guided perturbation在抑制伪影的同时保留信息信号。

Result: SiNGER在多个下游任务中实现了最先进的性能，并生成了更清晰、更可解释的表示。

Conclusion: SiNGER框架有效抑制了高效应伪影，同时保留了教师模型中的信息信号，从而显著提升了学生模型的表现。

Abstract: Vision Transformers are widely adopted as the backbone of vision foundation
models, but they are known to produce high-norm artifacts that degrade
representation quality. When knowledge distillation transfers these features to
students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to
artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from
larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an
inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative
signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided
Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses
artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled
teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided
perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the
refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this
perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal
structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \oursname consistently
improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple
downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.

Fast-SEnSeI, a lightweight, sensor-independent encoder module that enables
flexible, on-board cloud segmentation across multispectral sensors with varying
band configurations. Building upon SEnSeI-v2, Fast-SEnSeI integrates an
improved spectral descriptor, lightweight architecture, and robust padding-band
handling. It accepts arbitrary combinations of spectral bands and their
wavelengths, producing fixed-size feature maps that feed into a compact,
quantized segmentation model based on a modified U-Net. The module runs
efficiently on embedded CPUs using Apache TVM, while the segmentation model is
deployed on FPGA, forming a CPU-FPGA hybrid pipeline suitable for
space-qualified hardware. Evaluations on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 datasets
demonstrate accurate segmentation across diverse input configurations.

Result: SNCE在多种基准测试中展示了状态-of-the-art的目标概念去除效果，同时保持对非目标概念的生成能力。

Conclusion: SNCE方法在去除目标概念的同时，保持了图像生成质量，并且对抗攻击具有很强的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Text-to-image models exhibit remarkable capabilities in image generation.
However, they also pose safety risks of generating harmful content. A key
challenge of existing concept erasure methods is the precise removal of target
concepts while minimizing degradation of image quality. In this paper, we
propose Single Neuron-based Concept Erasure (SNCE), a novel approach that can
precisely prevent harmful content generation by manipulating only a single
neuron. Specifically, we train a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text
embeddings into a sparse, disentangled latent space, where individual neurons
align tightly with atomic semantic concepts. To accurately locate neurons
responsible for harmful concepts, we design a novel neuron identification
method based on the modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns. By
suppressing activations of the harmful concept-specific neuron, SNCE achieves
surgical precision in concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality.
Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that SNCE achieves
state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure, while preserving the
model's generation capabilities for non-target concepts. Additionally, our
method exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, significantly
outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Accurate point cloud segmentation for plant organs is crucial for 3D plant
phenotyping. Existing solutions are designed problem-specific with a focus on
certain plant species or specified sensor-modalities for data acquisition.
Furthermore, it is common to use extensive pre-processing and down-sample the
plant point clouds to meet hardware or neural network input size requirements.
We propose a simple, yet effective algorithm KDSS for sub-sampling of
biological point clouds that is agnostic to sensor data and plant species. The
main benefit of this approach is that we do not need to down-sample our input
data and thus, enable segmentation of the full-resolution point cloud.
Combining KD-SS with current state-of-the-art segmentation models shows
satisfying results evaluated on different modalities such as photogrammetry,
laser triangulation and LiDAR for various plant species. We propose KD-SS as
lightweight resolution-retaining alternative to intensive pre-processing and
down-sampling methods for plant organ segmentation regardless of used species
and sensor modality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的FG-BG分解方法在FS-OOD检测中表现出低鲁棒性，主要原因在于过于依赖局部类相似性和固定的背景提取策略。

Method: 通过学习背景提示以获取包含背景和图像语义信息的局部背景相似性，再结合局部类相似性进行背景提取，同时使用patch自校准调优来考虑样本的多样性，以灵活选择不同样本的背景补丁数量。

Result: 通过对真实世界数据集的广泛实验，Mambo在OOD检测和近OOD检测设置下的表现均优于现有最先进的方法。

Conclusion: Mambo框架在处理FS-OOD检测时，相较于现有方法具有更优的性能，解决了传统算法对局部类相似性的过度依赖和固定背景提取策略的问题。

Abstract: Existing foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods for the few-shot
out-of-distribution (FS-OOD) detection often suffer from low robustness due to
over-reliance on the local class similarity and a fixed background patch
extraction strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a new FG-BG
decomposition framework, namely Mambo, for FS-OOD detection. Specifically, we
propose to first learn a background prompt to obtain the local background
similarity containing both the background and image semantic information, and
then refine the local background similarity using the local class similarity.
As a result, we use both the refined local background similarity and the local
class similarity to conduct background extraction, reducing the dependence of
the local class similarity in previous methods. Furthermore, we propose the
patch self-calibrated tuning to consider the sample diversity to flexibly
select numbers of background patches for different samples, and thus exploring
the issue of fixed background extraction strategies in previous methods.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed
Mambo achieves the best performance, compared to SOTA methods in terms of OOD
detection and near OOD detection setting. The source code will be released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机划分数据集可能导致测试集不具代表性，从而影响模型的泛化能力和评估准确性。

Method: 引入迭代像素分层采样方法(IPS)和基于Wasserstein距离的遗传算法(WDES)来进行数据集划分。

Result: WDES通过最小化Wasserstein距离，优化了数据集的标签分布，使得模型在不同任务上表现更加稳定。

Conclusion: WDES优化了数据集划分的标签分布，使得在多样性不足的数据集中，模型评估更加准确，表现更加稳定。

Abstract: Random splitting of datasets in image segmentation often leads to
unrepresentative test sets, resulting in biased evaluations and poor model
generalization. While stratified sampling has proven effective for addressing
label distribution imbalance in classification tasks, extending these ideas to
segmentation remains challenging due to the multi-label structure and class
imbalance typically present in such data. Building on existing stratification
concepts, we introduce Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS), a straightforward,
label-aware sampling method tailored for segmentation tasks. Additionally, we
present Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES), a novel genetic
algorithm designed to minimize the Wasserstein distance, thereby optimizing the
similarity of label distributions across dataset splits. We prove that WDES is
globally optimal given enough generations. Using newly proposed statistical
heterogeneity metrics, we evaluate both methods against random sampling and
find that WDES consistently produces more representative splits. Applying WDES
across diverse segmentation tasks, including street scenes, medical imaging,
and satellite imagery, leads to lower performance variance and improved model
evaluation. Our results also highlight the particular value of WDES in handling
small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets, where conventional splitting
strategies are most prone to bias.

Abstract: Fine-grained classification models are designed to focus on the relevant
details necessary to distinguish highly similar classes, particularly when
intra-class variance is high and inter-class variance is low. Most existing
models rely on part annotations such as bounding boxes, part locations, or
textual attributes to enhance classification performance, while others employ
sophisticated techniques to automatically extract attention maps. We posit that
part-based approaches, including automatic cropping methods, suffer from an
incomplete representation of local features, which are fundamental for
distinguishing similar objects. While fine-grained classification aims to
recognize the leaves of a hierarchical structure, humans recognize objects by
also forming semantic associations. In this paper, we leverage semantic
associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals within
an end-to-end deep neural network model, termed EnGraf-Net. Extensive
experiments on three well-known datasets CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and
FGVC-Aircraft demonstrate the superiority of EnGraf-Net over many existing
fine-grained models, showing competitive performance with the most recent
state-of-the-art approaches, without requiring cropping techniques or manual
annotations.

Motivation: 随着对机器学习系统依赖程度的增加，确保其安全性变得至关重要，特别是在对抗攻击日益严重的背景下。

Method: 通过设计现实的对抗补丁，使用Creases Transformation技术对视觉变换器(ViTs)进行实验评估。

Result: 在四个微调的ViT模型上进行的二分类任务测试显示，攻击成功率在40.04%到99.97%之间变化，表明ViT模型对对抗攻击的脆弱性差异显著。

Conclusion: 研究表明，卷积神经网络的对抗补丁可以有效转移到视觉变换器，并且模型在对抗攻击下的脆弱性因子有所不同。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning systems has made their security a
critical concern. Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the
decision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches
or misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained
significant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance
compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against
adversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks,
particularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI
classification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing
realistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs.
non-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT)
technique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring
naturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of
adversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification
models. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary
person classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack
success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97%
(facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and
facebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%. These results confirm the
cross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches from CNNs to ViTs,
with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model
resilience to adversarial attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在提升视频概念转移的精确度与可控性，通过分解视频成关键组件并采用大语言模型进行指导。

Method: 通过空间和扩散时间步分解的进阶范式，利用DiT架构和自监督预训练策略提高表示学习，同时引入Chain-of-Prompt机制实现去噪扩散过程的逐步生成。

Result: 在多个参考图像和场景中，UniTransfer显示出卓越的视觉保真度和编辑能力，超越现有的基线效果。

Conclusion: UniTransfer能够实现高质量和可控的视频概念转移，优于现有基准，具有良好的视觉保真度和可编辑性。

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture UniTransfer, which introduces both spatial
and diffusion timestep decomposition in a progressive paradigm, achieving
precise and controllable video concept transfer. Specifically, in terms of
spatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the
foreground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this
decomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based
architecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in
the videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on
random masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from
large-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning
paradigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a
Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We
decompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and
leverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide
the generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset
called OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in
video concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse
reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual
fidelity and editability. Web Page:

Conclusion: VTTS能显著提升多模态大语言模型在视频对话、视频推理及时空感知等多项任务中的性能。

Abstract: Inducing reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is critical
for achieving human-level perception and understanding. Existing methods mainly
leverage LLM reasoning to analyze parsed visuals, often limited by static
perception stages. This paper introduces Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS), a
novel approach to enhance MLLMs' reasoning via iterative perception during
inference. VTTS mimics humans' hierarchical attention by progressively refining
focus on high-confidence spatio-temporal regions, guided by updated textual
predictions. Specifically, VTTS employs an Iterative Perception (ITP)
mechanism, incorporating reinforcement learning with spatio-temporal
supervision to optimize reasoning. To support this paradigm, we also present
VTTS-80K, a dataset tailored for iterative perception. These designs allows a
MLLM to enhance its performance by increasing its perceptual compute. Extensive
experiments validate VTTS's effectiveness and generalization across diverse
tasks and benchmarks. Our newly introduced Videochat-R1.5 model has achieved
remarkable improvements, with an average increase of over 5\%, compared to
robust baselines such as Qwen2.5VL-3B and -7B, across more than 15 benchmarks
that encompass video conversation, video reasoning, and spatio-temporal
perception.

Conclusion: Mammo-CLIP Dissect展示了卷积神经网络如何捕捉与乳腺X线成像相关的知识，并揭示了领域特定训练和任务特定适应如何影响概念学习。

Abstract: Understanding what deep learning (DL) models learn is essential for the safe
deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical settings. While previous
work has focused on pixel-based explainability methods, less attention has been
paid to the textual concepts learned by these models, which may better reflect
the reasoning used by clinicians. We introduce Mammo-CLIP Dissect, the first
concept-based explainability framework for systematically dissecting DL vision
models trained for mammography. Leveraging a mammography-specific
vision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) as a "dissector," our approach labels
neurons at specified layers with human-interpretable textual concepts and
quantifies their alignment to domain knowledge. Using Mammo-CLIP Dissect, we
investigate three key questions: (1) how concept learning differs between DL
vision models trained on general image datasets versus mammography-specific
datasets; (2) how fine-tuning for downstream mammography tasks affects concept
specialisation; and (3) which mammography-relevant concepts remain
underrepresented. We show that models trained on mammography data capture more
clinically relevant concepts and align more closely with radiologists'
workflows than models not trained on mammography data. Fine-tuning for
task-specific classification enhances the capture of certain concept categories
(e.g., benign calcifications) but can reduce coverage of others (e.g.,
density-related features), indicating a trade-off between specialisation and
generalisation. Our findings show that Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights
into how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture mammography-specific
knowledge. By comparing models across training data and fine-tuning regimes, we
reveal how domain-specific training and task-specific adaptation shape concept
learning. Code and concept set are available:

<details>

Motivation: 当前的多模态大型语言模型在视频推理过程中存在过程不一致性的问题，这影响了模型的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Method: 引入了一种基于动态时间规整(DTW)的强化学习框架，利用规则基础奖励对推理过程进行监督，避免了依赖外部奖励模型。

Result: MOSS-ChatV在MOSS-Video基准上达到了87.2%的成绩，并在MVBench和MMVU等视频基准测试中表现有所提升。

Conclusion: MOSS-ChatV能有效提高视频推理的一致性和稳定性，适用于多种架构，且在多项基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: Video reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), requiring models to move beyond static perception
toward coherent understanding of temporal dynamics in complex scenes. Yet
existing MLLMs often exhibit process inconsistency, where intermediate
reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when the final answer is correct,
undermining interpretability and robustness. To address this issue, we
introduce MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework with a Dynamic Time
Warping (DTW)-based process reward. This rule-based reward aligns reasoning
traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process
supervision without auxiliary reward models. We further identify dynamic state
prediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a
benchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to
fine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation.
MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on
general video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently
yields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2,
confirming its broad applicability. Evaluations with GPT-4o-as-judge further
show that MOSS-ChatV produces more consistent and stable reasoning traces.

Result: 通过广泛的实验，证明我们的模型在性能上大幅优于最新的技术。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的方法在生成视频时有效结合了相机和物体运动，显著超越了现有最先进的技术。

Abstract: Generating videos guided by camera trajectories poses significant challenges
in achieving consistency and generalizability, particularly when both camera
and object motions are present. Existing approaches often attempt to learn
these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative
motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by
converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable
diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to
the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic
object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the
desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while
maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our
model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.

Method: 分析数据维度和复杂度对判别器在与生成器竞争中的影响，使用Kolmogorov复杂度衡量数据集的内在结构。

Result: 简单和高度复杂的数据集降低了合成图像的可检测性，而中等复杂度的数据集则提高了检测的可行性。

Conclusion: 中等复杂度的数据集为区分真实与合成图像提供了最佳条件，生成器未能完全捕捉数据分布，其错误依然明显。

Abstract: The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between
synthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and
discriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which
discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key
factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased
dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle
inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov
complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very
simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic
images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme
diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets
create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully
capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.

Motivation: 旨在解决CLIP模型在多分辨率图像处理时的计算效率和准确率的权衡问题。

Method: 通过多层小波分解取代标准的补丁嵌入，结合关键-值缓存和因果跨层注意机制实现自适应推理。

Result: WAVECLIP在零-shot分类任务中表现良好，采用简单的基于置信度的门控机制实现了自适应的早期退出。

Conclusion: WAVECLIP模型以轻量化蒸馏的方式实现了自适应的计算和精度平衡，在保持竞争性准确率的同时大幅降低计算开销。

Abstract: We introduce WAVECLIP, a single unified model for adaptive resolution
inference in CLIP, enabled by wavelet-based tokenization. WAVECLIP replaces
standard patch embeddings with a multi-level wavelet decomposition, enabling
the model to process images coarse to fine while naturally supporting multiple
resolutions within the same model. At inference time, the model begins with low
resolution tokens and refines only when needed, using key-value caching and
causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, effectively introducing to
the model only new information when needed. We evaluate WAVECLIP in zero-shot
classification, demonstrating that a simple confidence-based gating mechanism
enables adaptive early exits. This allows users to dynamically choose a
compute-accuracy trade-off using a single deployed model. Our approach requires
only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher and achieves
competitive accuracy with significant computational savings.

Motivation: 探讨量化对CLIP性能的影响，尤其是超越准确度的其他关键指标。

Method: 对CLIP模型进行大规模量化评估，衡量准确性和其他可靠性指标。

Result: 量化在通常校准不足的预训练模型中显著改善校准，而对过度自信的模型则通常导致校准下降，但在OOD检测等其他指标上依然可能提升。

Conclusion: 量化可以改善CLIP模型的校准，同时提升零样本准确性与OOD鲁棒性，挑战了效率与性能之间的严格权衡观念。

Abstract: The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models
(VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for
the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still
overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance
beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale
evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution
accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing
counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that
quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident
pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants.
Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other
reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these
same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific
quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in
zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a
strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights
for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable,
and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.

Result: 在两个基准测试上，CARINOX在提高平均对齐分数方面表现优异，分别提升了16%和11%。

Conclusion: CARINOX框架在提高文本图像对齐方面显著优于现有方法，同时保持了图像质量和多样性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, can produce
high-quality and diverse images but often fail to achieve compositional
alignment, particularly when prompts describe complex object relationships,
attributes, or spatial arrangements. Recent inference-time approaches address
this by optimizing or exploring the initial noise under the guidance of reward
functions that score text-image alignment without requiring model fine-tuning.
While promising, each strategy has intrinsic limitations when used alone:
optimization can stall due to poor initialization or unfavorable search
trajectories, whereas exploration may require a prohibitively large number of
samples to locate a satisfactory output. Our analysis further shows that
neither single reward metrics nor ad-hoc combinations reliably capture all
aspects of compositionality, leading to weak or inconsistent guidance. To
overcome these challenges, we present Category-Aware Reward-based Initial Noise
Optimization and Exploration (CARINOX), a unified framework that combines noise
optimization and exploration with a principled reward selection procedure
grounded in correlation with human judgments. Evaluations on two complementary
benchmarks covering diverse compositional challenges show that CARINOX raises
average alignment scores by +16% on T2I-CompBench++ and +11% on the HRS
benchmark, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art optimization and
exploration-based methods across all major categories, while preserving image
quality and diversity. The project page is available at

Abstract: While table understanding increasingly relies on pixel-only settings where
tables are processed as visual representations, current benchmarks
predominantly use synthetic renderings that lack the complexity and visual
diversity of real-world tables. Additionally, existing visual table
understanding (VTU) datasets offer fixed examples with single visualizations
and pre-defined instructions, providing no access to underlying serialized data
for reformulation. We introduce TABLET, a large-scale VTU dataset with 4
million examples across 20 tasks, grounded in 2 million unique tables where 88%
preserve original visualizations. Each example includes paired image-HTML
representations, comprehensive metadata, and provenance information linking
back to the source datasets. Fine-tuning vision-language models like
Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on seen and unseen VTU tasks while
increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations. By preserving
original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified
large-scale collection, TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and
extensible evaluation of future VTU models.

Conclusion: FastSHAP方法在忠实性和信息效率方面优于其他竞争方法，且基于超像素的符合性度量效果更佳。

Abstract: Feature attribution methods are widely used for explaining image-based
predictions, as they provide feature-level insights that can be intuitively
visualized. However, such explanations often vary in their robustness and may
fail to faithfully reflect the reasoning of the underlying black-box model. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel conformal prediction-based
approach that enables users to directly control the fidelity of the generated
explanations. The method identifies a subset of salient features that is
sufficient to preserve the model's prediction, regardless of the information
carried by the excluded features, and without demanding access to ground-truth
explanations for calibration. Four conformity functions are proposed to
quantify the extent to which explanations conform to the model's predictions.
The approach is empirically evaluated using five explainers across six image
datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that FastSHAP consistently
outperforms the competing methods in terms of both fidelity and informational
efficiency, the latter measured by the size of the explanation regions.
Furthermore, the results reveal that conformity measures based on super-pixels
are more effective than their pixel-wise counterparts.

Motivation: 当前手语理解方法面临三个主要限制：弱语义基础、局部细节与全局上下文的不平衡，以及跨模态学习的低效。

Method: 提出了Sigma，一个统一的基于骨架的手语理解框架，包括与语言上下文丰富视觉特征的签名意识早期融合机制、联合最大化不同模态间特征对齐的层次对齐学习策略，以及结合对比学习、文本匹配和语言建模的统一预训练框架。

Conclusion: Sigma在多项基准测试中实现了孤立手语识别、连续手语识别和无词汇手语翻译的新状态，证明了语义信息丰富的预训练和骨架数据作为手语理解的独立解决方案的有效性。

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective for learning transferable features in sign
language understanding (SLU) tasks. Recently, skeleton-based methods have
gained increasing attention because they can robustly handle variations in
subjects and backgrounds without being affected by appearance or environmental
factors. Current SLU methods continue to face three key limitations: 1) weak
semantic grounding, as models often capture low-level motion patterns from
skeletal data but struggle to relate them to linguistic meaning; 2) imbalance
between local details and global context, with models either focusing too
narrowly on fine-grained cues or overlooking them for broader context; and 3)
inefficient cross-modal learning, as constructing semantically aligned
representations across modalities remains difficult. To address these, we
propose Sigma, a unified skeleton-based SLU framework featuring: 1) a
sign-aware early fusion mechanism that facilitates deep interaction between
visual and textual modalities, enriching visual features with linguistic
context; 2) a hierarchical alignment learning strategy that jointly maximises
agreements across different levels of paired features from different
modalities, effectively capturing both fine-grained details and high-level
semantic relationships; and 3) a unified pre-training framework that combines
contrastive learning, text matching and language modelling to promote semantic
consistency and generalisation. Sigma achieves new state-of-the-art results on
isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and
gloss-free sign language translation on multiple benchmarks spanning different
sign and spoken languages, demonstrating the impact of semantically informative
pre-training and the effectiveness of skeletal data as a stand-alone solution
for SLU.

Result: 没有单一的度量标准能够在所有任务中始终如一地表现良好，VQA基础的度量标准虽然受欢迎，但并不总是优于其他指标，而某些嵌入基础的度量在特定情况下表现较强。

Conclusion: 在组合文本-图像评估中，没有单一的度量标准能在所有任务中稳定表现，不同的度量在特定情况下表现各异。

Abstract: Text-image generation has advanced rapidly, but assessing whether outputs
truly capture the objects, attributes, and relations described in prompts
remains a central challenge. Evaluation in this space relies heavily on
automated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity
rather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported
progress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to
understand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present
a broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation.
Our analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across
diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families
align with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs
consistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional
problem. Notably, VQA-based metrics, though popular, are not uniformly
superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific
cases. Image-only metrics, as expected, contribute little to compositional
evaluation, as they are designed for perceptual quality rather than alignment.
These findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric
selection, both for trustworthy evaluation and for their use as reward models
in generation. Project page is available at

TL;DR: 本研究提出的SlideMamba框架通过自适应熵权融合策略，显著提升了基因融合与突变状态预测的准确性，展现了WSI分析的广泛应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在提高WSI分析的效率，提取局部和全球信息的有用表示，以支持临床与生物任务。

Method: 结合Mamba架构与图神经网络（GNN），实施了一种自适应融合策略，捕捉远近空间关系与上下文依赖。

Result: 在PRAUC、ROC AUC、敏感性和特异性等指标上超越多种方法，验证了集成架构的强大。

Conclusion: SlideMamba框架在WSI分析中表现优异，特别是在基因融合和突变状态预测任务中，显示出其有效性和潜力。

Abstract: Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting
meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various
clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep
learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture
both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies,
offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules
excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize
fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these
complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an
entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically
balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the
branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the
contextual importance of local versus global information for different
downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a
representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our
framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve
(PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39
\pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a
prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves
competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm
0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength
of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive
fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of
spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.

Motivation: 解决当前三维生成模型在细粒度、跨模态控制方面的不足，以提升其可控性和应用的实际性。

Method: 通过一个统一的跨模态架构整合多种条件信号，并采用渐进式的、注意难度的采样策略进行训练。

Conclusion: Hunyuan3D-Omni 提供了更精确的控制，改善了生成准确性并增强了生产工作流程的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D-native generative models have accelerated asset
creation for games, film, and design. However, most methods still rely
primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal
controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption. To address this
gap, we present Hunyuan3D-Omni, a unified framework for fine-grained,
controllable 3D asset generation built on Hunyuan3D 2.1. In addition to images,
Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose
priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry,
topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model
unifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a
progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control
modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal
pose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust
multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show
that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable
geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production
workflows.

Motivation: 为了解决CNN在预测中依赖表面相关性的缺陷，并减少对人工专家标注的依赖。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型自动生成语义注意力图，引入辅助损失来对齐CNN的注意力与语言引导的图。

Result: 在ColoredMNIST和DecoyMNIST数据集上的实验表明，该方法在ColoredMNIST上达到了最先进的性能，并在DecoyMNIST上与依赖标注的基线保持竞争力，证明了模型的泛化能力和更好的人类直觉反映。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过利用视觉语言模型生成语义注意力图，并引入辅助损失，使CNN的注意力与这些图对齐，从而促进更可靠的决策。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) frequently "cheat" by exploiting
superficial correlations, raising concerns about whether they make predictions
for the right reasons. Inspired by cognitive science, which highlights the role
of attention in robust human perception, recent methods have sought to guide
model attention using concept-based supervision and explanation regularization.
However, these techniques depend on labor-intensive, expert-provided
annotations, limiting their scalability. We propose a scalable framework that
leverages vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention
maps using natural language prompts. By introducing an auxiliary loss that
aligns CNN attention with these language-guided maps, our approach promotes
more reliable and cognitively plausible decision-making without manual
annotation. Experiments on challenging datasets, ColoredMNIST and DecoyMNIST,
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and
remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST,
demonstrating improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and model
attention that better reflects human intuition.

TL;DR: 我们为文本到图像生成模型中的幻觉现象提供了新定义和分类，为模型评估提供了更全面的基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然幻觉现象在语言和视觉模型中的研究较多，但在文本到图像生成模型中尚未明确界定。

Method: 通过定义幻觉为偏见驱动的偏差，并提出三类幻觉：属性、关系和对象幻觉。

Result: 我们的框架能够引入评估的上限，并为更丰富地评估T2I模型提供了基础。

Conclusion: 我们提出了一种分类法，为文本到图像生成模型中的幻觉现象提供了清晰的框架，并揭示了隐藏的偏见。

Abstract: In language and vision-language models, hallucination is broadly understood
as content generated from a model's prior knowledge or biases rather than from
the given input. While this phenomenon has been studied in those domains, it
has not been clearly framed for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Existing
evaluations mainly focus on alignment, checking whether prompt-specified
elements appear, but overlook what the model generates beyond the prompt. We
argue for defining hallucination in T2I as bias-driven deviations and propose a
taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.
This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden
biases, providing a foundation for richer assessment of T2I models.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical medical imaging modality in
clinical diagnosis and research, yet its complexity and heterogeneity pose
challenges for automated analysis, particularly in scalable and generalizable
machine learning applications. While foundation models have revolutionized
natural language and vision tasks, their application to MRI remains limited due
to data scarcity and narrow anatomical focus. In this work, we present
Decipher-MR, a 3D MRI-specific vision-language foundation model trained on a
large-scale dataset comprising 200,000 MRI series from over 22,000 studies
spanning diverse anatomical regions, sequences, and pathologies. Decipher-MR
integrates self-supervised vision learning with report-guided text supervision
to build robust, generalizable representations, enabling effective adaptation
across broad applications. To enable robust and diverse clinical tasks with
minimal computational overhead, Decipher-MR supports a modular design that
enables tuning of lightweight, task-specific decoders attached to a frozen
pretrained encoder. Following this setting, we evaluate Decipher-MR across
diverse benchmarks including disease classification, demographic prediction,
anatomical localization, and cross-modal retrieval, demonstrating consistent
performance gains over existing foundation models and task-specific approaches.
Our results establish Decipher-MR as a scalable and versatile foundation for
MRI-based AI, facilitating efficient development across clinical and research
domains.

Conclusion: SQ-InstructBLIP方法通过生成图像感知的子问题和子答案，能够更准确地推理，从而提升视觉问答(VQA)任务的表现。

Abstract: The field of vision-language understanding has been actively researched in
recent years, thanks to the development of Large Language Models~(LLMs).
However, it still needs help with problems requiring multi-step reasoning, even
for very simple questions. Recent studies adopt LLMs to tackle this problem by
iteratively generating sub-questions and answers. However, there are
disadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not
available using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal
mechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs.
To solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP,
which improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative
sub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists
of a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture.
Questioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer
the main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question
considering the generated sub-question information. Our experiments show that
the proposed method SQ-InstructBLIP, which uses the generated sub-questions as
additional information when solving the VQA task, performs more accurate
reasoning than the previous works.

Motivation: 现有方法在真实场景中常因个体间差异而无法稳定泛化，因此我们提出个人无关的微动作识别框架，以提升心理评估和人机交互的有效性。

Method: 我们提出的框架集成了分布稳健优化原则，包含特征层和损失层的两个插件组件，分别通过时间-频率对齐模块和群体不变正则化损失进行工作。

Result: 通过在大规模MA-52数据集上的实验，我们的框架在准确性和鲁棒性方面超越了现有方法，稳定泛化于细粒度条件下。

Conclusion: 我们的框架在MA-52数据集上展示了比现有方法更高的准确性和鲁棒性，实现了在细粒度条件下的稳定泛化。

Abstract: Micro-action Recognition is vital for psychological assessment and
human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often fail in real-world
scenarios because inter-person variability causes the same action to manifest
differently, hindering robust generalization. To address this, we propose the
Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework, which
integrates Distributionally Robust Optimization principles to learn
person-agnostic representations. Our framework contains two plug-and-play
components operating at the feature and loss levels. At the feature level, the
Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module normalizes person-specific motion
characteristics with a dual-branch design: the temporal branch applies
Wasserstein-regularized alignment to stabilize dynamic trajectories, while the
frequency branch introduces variance-guided perturbations to enhance robustness
against person-specific spectral differences. A consistency-driven fusion
mechanism integrates both branches. At the loss level, the Group-Invariant
Regularized Loss partitions samples into pseudo-groups to simulate unseen
person-specific distributions. By up-weighting boundary cases and regularizing
subgroup variance, it forces the model to generalize beyond easy or frequent
samples, thus enhancing robustness to difficult variations. Experiments on the
large-scale MA-52 dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under
fine-grained conditions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于VGGT的语义匹配方法，克服了几何模糊性和数据不足带来的挑战，取得了优异的实验结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语义匹配方法在几何模糊性和最近邻规则方面存在两大局限，亟需几何感知的像素描述子和整体稠密对应机制。

Method: 通过重用VGGT的早期特征阶段，微调后续阶段，并添加双向对应的语义头来保留VGGT的内在优势，同时通过循环一致性训练策略、合成数据增强和渐进训练方案来适应数据不足的语义匹配场景。

Result: 我们的方案通过灵活适应VGGT，解决了数据稀缺问题，展现了优越的几何意识和匹配能力。

Conclusion: 我们的方案在几何感知、匹配可靠性和流形保持方面表现优越，超越了之前的基准。

Abstract: Semantic matching aims to establish pixel-level correspondences between
instances of the same category and represents a fundamental task in computer
vision. Existing approaches suffer from two limitations: (i) Geometric
Ambiguity: Their reliance on 2D foundation model features (e.g., Stable
Diffusion, DINO) often fails to disambiguate symmetric structures, requiring
extra fine-tuning yet lacking generalization; (ii) Nearest-Neighbor Rule: Their
pixel-wise matching ignores cross-image invisibility and neglects manifold
preservation. These challenges call for geometry-aware pixel descriptors and
holistic dense correspondence mechanisms. Inspired by recent advances in 3D
geometric foundation models, we turn to VGGT, which provides geometry-grounded
features and holistic dense matching capabilities well aligned with these
needs. However, directly transferring VGGT is challenging, as it was originally
designed for geometry matching within cross views of a single instance,
misaligned with cross-instance semantic matching, and further hindered by the
scarcity of dense semantic annotations. To address this, we propose an approach
that (i) retains VGGT's intrinsic strengths by reusing early feature stages,
fine-tuning later ones, and adding a semantic head for bidirectional
correspondences; and (ii) adapts VGGT to the semantic matching scenario under
data scarcity through cycle-consistent training strategy, synthetic data
augmentation, and progressive training recipe with aliasing artifact
mitigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior geometry awareness, matching reliability, and manifold preservation,
outperforming previous baselines.

Result: 在四个不同医疗场景的数据集上进行的实验表明，MedVSR在重建性能和效率上都表现突出。

Conclusion: MedVSR在重建性能和效率上显著优于现有视频超分辨率模型，特别是在多样化的医疗场景中。

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) medical videos are vital for accurate diagnosis, yet are
hard to acquire due to hardware limitations and physiological constraints.
Clinically, the collected low-resolution (LR) medical videos present unique
challenges for video super-resolution (VSR) models, including camera shake,
noise, and abrupt frame transitions, which result in significant optical flow
errors and alignment difficulties. Additionally, tissues and organs exhibit
continuous and nuanced structures, but current VSR models are prone to
introducing artifacts and distorted features that can mislead doctors. To this
end, we propose MedVSR, a tailored framework for medical VSR. It first employs
Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) to address the imprecise alignment by
projecting distant frames as control matrices within state-space models,
enabling the selective propagation of consistent and informative features to
neighboring frames for effective alignment. Moreover, we design an Inner
State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) module that enhances tissue structures and
reduces artifacts with joint long-range spatial feature learning and
large-kernel short-range information aggregation. Experiments across four
datasets in diverse medical scenarios, including endoscopy and cataract
surgeries, show that MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in
reconstruction performance and efficiency. Code released at

Conclusion: 本研究通过提出方差感知采样（VAS）和发布大量高质量的链式思维数据，提升了多模态推理模型的优化稳定性与性能。

Abstract: Large multimodal reasoning models have achieved rapid progress, but their
advancement is constrained by two major limitations: the absence of open,
large-scale, high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) data, and the instability
of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in post-training. Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), the standard framework for RL fine-tuning, is prone
to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low, which weakens optimization
signals and impairs convergence. This work makes three contributions: (1) We
propose Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS), a data selection strategy guided by
Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory
diversity to promote reward variance and stabilize policy optimization. (2) We
release large-scale, carefully curated resources containing ~1.6M long CoT
cold-start data and ~15k RL QA pairs, designed to ensure quality, difficulty,
and diversity, along with a fully reproducible end-to-end training codebase.
(3) We open-source a family of multimodal reasoning models in multiple scales,
establishing standardized baselines for the community. Experiments across
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both the
curated data and the proposed VAS. Comprehensive ablation studies and analyses
provide further insight into the contributions of each component. In addition,
we theoretically establish that reward variance lower-bounds the expected
policy gradient magnitude, with VAS serving as a practical mechanism to realize
this guarantee. Our code, data, and checkpoints are available at

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation models (FMs), pre-trained on massive
unlabelled datasets, have the potential to drastically change AI applications
in ocean science, where labelled data are often sparse and expensive to
collect. In this work, we describe a new foundation model using the Prithvi-EO
Vision Transformer architecture which has been pre-trained to reconstruct data
from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). We evaluate the
model by fine-tuning on two downstream marine earth observation tasks. We first
assess model performance compared to current baseline models used to quantify
chlorophyll concentration. We then evaluate the FMs ability to refine remote
sensing-based estimates of ocean primary production. Our results demonstrate
the utility of self-trained FMs for marine monitoring, in particular for making
use of small amounts of high quality labelled data and in capturing detailed
spatial patterns of ocean colour whilst matching point observations. We
conclude that this new generation of geospatial AI models has the potential to
provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role
in global climate processes.

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a
new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate
shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern
text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential
physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without
resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually
inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a
training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized
Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained
customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject
representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression
guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate
low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous
benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and
challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate
shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and
DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g.,
DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward).
Code and benchmark will be publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: Learning-based 3D reconstruction models, represented by Visual Geometry
Grounded Transformers (VGGTs), have made remarkable progress with the use of
large-scale transformers. Their prohibitive computational and memory costs
severely hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has
become a common practice for compressing and accelerating models. However, we
empirically observe that PTQ faces unique obstacles when compressing
billion-scale VGGTs: the data-independent special tokens induce heavy-tailed
activation distributions, while the multi-view nature of 3D data makes
calibration sample selection highly unstable. This paper proposes the first
Quantization framework for VGGTs, namely QuantVGGT. This mainly relies on two
technical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained
Quantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local
channel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel
variance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which
filters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse
calibration clusters to ensure stable quantization ranges. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results
across different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art generic quantization method with a great margin. We highlight
that our 4-bit QuantVGGT can deliver a 3.7$\times$ memory reduction and
2.5$\times$ acceleration in real-hardware inference, while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy above 98\% of its full-precision counterpart. This
demonstrates the vast advantages and practicality of QuantVGGT in
resource-constrained scenarios. Our code is released in

TL;DR: 本研究提出NewtonGen框架，解决大型文本到视频生成中的物理一致性和可控性问题，结合数据驱动和可学习的物理原理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对当前文本到视频生成模型在物理一致性和可控性方面的根本不足，提出改进方法。

Method: 提出了一个框架NewtonGen，核心是可训练的神经牛顿动力学(NND)，能够建模和预测各种牛顿运动，注入潜在的动力约束。

Result: NewtonGen通过联合利用数据先验和动力指导，实现了更物理一致的视频合成。

Conclusion: NewtonGen通过结合数据驱动合成和可学习的物理原理，实现了物理一致的视频合成和精确的参数控制。

Abstract: A primary bottleneck in large-scale text-to-video generation today is
physical consistency and controllability. Despite recent advances,
state-of-the-art models often produce unrealistic motions, such as objects
falling upward, or abrupt changes in velocity and direction. Moreover, these
models lack precise parameter control, struggling to generate physically
consistent dynamics under different initial conditions. We argue that this
fundamental limitation stems from current models learning motion distributions
solely from appearance, while lacking an understanding of the underlying
dynamics. In this work, we propose NewtonGen, a framework that integrates
data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles. At its core lies
trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND), which can model and predict a
variety of Newtonian motions, thereby injecting latent dynamical constraints
into the video generation process. By jointly leveraging data priors and
dynamical guidance, NewtonGen enables physically consistent video synthesis
with precise parameter control.

generation. We introduce two key innovations: "timestep sharing" to reduce
gradient noise and "split-timestep fine-tuning" to improve prompt alignment.
Combined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder
restructuring and specialized quantization, our system enables both rapid
generation and memory-efficient deployment across different hardware
configurations. This democratizes access across the full spectrum of devices,
from mobile phones to desktop computers. Through extensive evaluation including

outperforms existing few-step methods, making advanced generative AI truly
accessible for practical deployment.

### [88] [Interpreting Public Sentiment in Diplomacy Events: A Counterfactual Analysis Framework Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20367)
*Leyi Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种新框架，通过反事实文本生成来改变公众对外交事件的情感反应，成功率达70%，为政策制定提供数据驱动的建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改善外交事件的叙事框架，从而影响公众情感，提升政策实施的效果。

Method: 使用大型语言模型进行文本修改，结合传播理论和领域专家的指导，创造反事实生成算法。

Result: 构建了一个数据集，通过语言模型预测公众对外交事件的反应，成功地将公众情感从负面转变为中性或积极。

Conclusion: 该框架可以有效地促进公众情绪向积极方向转变，成功率为70%。

Abstract: Diplomatic events consistently prompt widespread public discussion and
debate. Public sentiment plays a critical role in diplomacy, as a good
sentiment provides vital support for policy implementation, helps resolve
international issues, and shapes a nation's international image. Traditional
methods for gauging public sentiment, such as large-scale surveys or manual
content analysis of media, are typically time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
lack the capacity for forward-looking analysis. We propose a novel framework
that identifies specific modifications for diplomatic event narratives to shift
public sentiment from negative to neutral or positive. First, we train a
language model to predict public reaction towards diplomatic events. To this
end, we construct a dataset comprising descriptions of diplomatic events and
their associated public discussions. Second, guided by communication theories
and in collaboration with domain experts, we predetermined several textual
features for modification, ensuring that any alterations changed the event's
narrative framing while preserving its core facts.We develop a counterfactual
generation algorithm that employs a large language model to systematically
produce modified versions of an original text. The results show that this
framework successfully shifted public sentiment to a more favorable state with
a 70\% success rate. This framework can therefore serve as a practical tool for
diplomats, policymakers, and communication specialists, offering data-driven
insights on how to frame diplomatic initiatives or report on events to foster a
more desirable public sentiment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的框架，通过说话者风格感知锚定音素，解决跨语言情感识别中的发音和个体表达差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨语言情感识别因语言、发音和个体表达风格的差异而面临挑战，需要有效的框架来对齐不同语言和说话者的情感表达。

Method: 构建情感特定的说话者社区，通过图形聚类捕捉共享的说话者特征，并在说话者和音素空间中应用双空间锚定。

Result: 在MSP-Podcast和BIIC-Podcast语料库上的评估表明，与竞争基线相比，提出的方法在泛化能力上得到了显著提升，揭示了跨语言情感表征的共性。

Conclusion: 提出的基于说话者风格感知的音素锚定框架能够有效提高跨语言情感识别的准确性和可用性。

Abstract: Cross-lingual speech emotion recognition (SER) remains a challenging task due
to differences in phonetic variability and speaker-specific expressive styles
across languages. Effectively capturing emotion under such diverse conditions
requires a framework that can align the externalization of emotions across
different speakers and languages. To address this problem, we propose a
speaker-style aware phoneme anchoring framework that aligns emotional
expression at the phonetic and speaker levels. Our method builds
emotion-specific speaker communities via graph-based clustering to capture
shared speaker traits. Using these groups, we apply dual-space anchoring in
speaker and phonetic spaces to enable better emotion transfer across languages.
Evaluations on the MSP-Podcast (English) and BIIC-Podcast (Taiwanese Mandarin)
corpora demonstrate improved generalization over competitive baselines and
provide valuable insights into the commonalities in cross-lingual emotion
representation.

Motivation: LLM在自动化复杂物理系统的数值实验中的应用尚未被充分探讨，因此需要一个系统的评估方法。

Method: 通过构建CFDLLMBench基准测试套件，结合任务分类和评估框架，评估LLM在CFD领域的性能。

Result: CFDLLMBench通过三个部分评估LLM的CFD知识、数值推理和工作流实施能力，提供可重复的结果和性能量化。

Conclusion: CFDLLMBench为大语言模型在复杂物理系统中的数值实验自动化提供了坚实的基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across

CFDQuery, CFDCodeBench, and FoamBench -- designed to holistically evaluate LLM
performance across three key competencies: graduate-level CFD knowledge,
numerical and physical reasoning of CFD, and context-dependent implementation
of CFD workflows. Grounded in real-world CFD practices, our benchmark combines
a detailed task taxonomy with a rigorous evaluation framework to deliver
reproducible results and quantify LLM performance across code executability,

TL;DR: 本研究比较了多种机器学习方法在区分AI生成文本和人类写作方面的表现，发现DistilBERT效果最佳，强调了单一模型在AI文本检测中的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的广泛应用，亟需可靠的AI文本检测以维护学术诚信、知识产权，并防止错误信息传播。

Method: 使用250对不同研究主题的摘要数据集，比较经典和基于变换器的机器学习检测技术。

Result: DistilBERT表现最佳，Logistic回归和BERT-Custom作为良好替代方案，而LSTM和BERT-N-gram效果较差。

Conclusion: DistilBERT在检测AI生成文本方面表现最好，强调了单一变换器模型的优越性。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has
blurred the line between human and AI-generated texts, raising urgent questions
about academic integrity, intellectual property, and the spread of
misinformation. Thus, reliable AI-text detection is needed for fair assessment
to safeguard human authenticity and cultivate trust in digital communication.
In this study, we investigate how well current machine learning (ML) approaches
can distinguish ChatGPT-3.5-generated texts from human-written texts employing
a labeled data set of 250 pairs of abstracts from a wide range of research
topics. We test and compare both classical (Logistic Regression armed with
classical Bag-of-Words, POS, and TF-IDF features) and transformer-based (BERT
augmented with N-grams, DistilBERT, BERT with a lightweight custom classifier,
and LSTM-based N-gram models) ML detection techniques. As we aim to assess each
model's performance in detecting AI-generated research texts, we also aim to
test whether an ensemble of these models can outperform any single detector.
Results show DistilBERT achieves the overall best performance, while Logistic
Regression and BERT-Custom offer solid, balanced alternatives; LSTM- and
BERT-N-gram approaches lag. The max voting ensemble of the three best models
fails to surpass DistilBERT itself, highlighting the primacy of a single
transformer-based representation over mere model diversity. By comprehensively
assessing the strengths and weaknesses of these AI-text detection approaches,
this work lays a foundation for more robust transformer frameworks with larger,
richer datasets to keep pace with ever-improving generative AI models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管日语资源丰富，但用于训练准确的带重音标记的音素转录模型的数据量仍然很少，因此亟需应对数据稀疏的问题。

Method: 提出了两种方法：首先，采用多任务训练引入辅助损失函数，以利用仅有书面标注的发音训练数据；其次，融合两个估计器，一个用于音素字母串，另一个用于文本令牌序列。

Result: 结果表明，采用多任务学习和融合方法之后，平均音节标签错误率显著降低，从12.3%降至7.1%。

Conclusion: 我们的方法有效降低了日语发音标签的错误率，证明了多任务学习和融合技术的有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents methods for building speech recognizers tailored for
Japanese speaking assessment tasks. Specifically, we build a speech recognizer
that outputs phonemic labels with accent markers. Although Japanese is
resource-rich, there is only a small amount of data for training models to
produce accurate phonemic transcriptions that include accent marks. We propose
two methods to mitigate data sparsity. First, a multitask training scheme
introduces auxiliary loss functions to estimate orthographic text labels and
pitch patterns of the input signal, so that utterances with only orthographic
annotations can be leveraged in training. The second fuses two estimators, one
over phonetic alphabet strings, and the other over text token sequences. To
combine these estimates we develop an algorithm based on the finite-state
transducer framework. Our results indicate that the use of multitask learning
and fusion is effective for building an accurate phonemic recognizer. We show
that this approach is advantageous compared to the use of generic multilingual
recognizers. The relative advantages of the proposed methods were also
compared. Our proposed methods reduced the average of mora-label error rates
from 12.3% to 7.1% over the CSJ core evaluation sets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管稀疏自编码器（SAE）在从大型语言模型提取可解释特征方面表现出色，但这些特征与人类理解的概念之间没有内在对齐，导致解释过程繁琐且劳动密集。

Method: 提出了一种名为ConceptViz的可视分析系统，利用识别、解释和验证的流程，允许用户查询稀疏自编码器（SAE）并探索概念与特征的对应关系。

Result: 通过两个使用场景和用户研究，证明了ConceptViz的有效性，显示其在促进大型语言模型的可解释性研究方面的贡献。

Conclusion: ConceptViz通过简化有意义的概念表示的发现与验证，增强了对大型语言模型解释性的研究，有助于研究人员构建更准确的LLM特征心理模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a
wide range of natural language tasks. Understanding how LLMs internally
represent knowledge remains a significant challenge. Despite Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising technique for extracting
interpretable features from LLMs, SAE features do not inherently align with
human-understandable concepts, making their interpretation cumbersome and
labor-intensive. To bridge the gap between SAE features and human concepts, we
present ConceptViz, a visual analytics system designed for exploring concepts
in LLMs. ConceptViz implements a novel dentification => Interpretation =>
Validation pipeline, enabling users to query SAEs using concepts of interest,
interactively explore concept-to-feature alignments, and validate the
correspondences through model behavior verification. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of ConceptViz through two usage scenarios and a user study. Our
results show that ConceptViz enhances interpretability research by streamlining
the discovery and validation of meaningful concept representations in LLMs,
ultimately aiding researchers in building more accurate mental models of LLM
features. Our code and user guide are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了MI-Fuse框架，通过利用源域教师模型和LALM，提升了情绪识别的适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实际应用中，语音情感识别（SER）常因领域不匹配而失败，这促使研究者探索如何利用只通过API接入的强大LALM进行跨域适配。

Method: 提出了一个去噪标签融合框架MI-Fuse，结合了源域训练的SER分类器作为辅助教师，通过多次随机预测和互信息加权不确定性稳定训练。

Result: 在三个公开情感数据集和六个跨域迁移中，学生模型的表现超越了LALM，并较最强基线提高了3.9%。

Conclusion: 该方法增强了情绪感知的语音系统，实现了在不共享源数据的情况下的现实适应。

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) show strong zero-shot ability on speech
tasks, suggesting promise for speech emotion recognition (SER). However, SER in
real-world deployments often fails under domain mismatch, where source data are
unavailable and powerful LALMs are accessible only through an API. We ask:
given only unlabeled target-domain audio and an API-only LALM, can a student
model be adapted to outperform the LALM in the target domain? To this end, we
propose MI-Fuse, a denoised label fusion framework that supplements the LALM
with a source-domain trained SER classifier as an auxiliary teacher. The
framework draws multiple stochastic predictions from both teachers, weights
their mean distributions by mutual-information-based uncertainty, and
stabilizes training with an exponential moving average teacher. Experiments
across three public emotion datasets and six cross-domain transfers show
consistent gains, with the student surpassing the LALM and outperforming the
strongest baseline by 3.9%. This approach strengthens emotion-aware speech
systems without sharing source data, enabling realistic adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了改善RAG性能，关键在于识别和过滤不利的检索内容，并更好地整合模型的内部知识与来自检索的外部知识。

Method: 设计了一种基于强化学习的训练框架，明确引导模型的自我知识，并以句子级别的粒度过滤无关内容，同时保留有用知识。

Result: 实验结果表明，SKILL-RAG不仅提升了生成质量，而且显著减少了输入文档数量，验证了自我知识在高质量检索选择中的重要性。

Conclusion: SKILL-RAG方法通过利用模型的自我知识，筛选出有助于回答特定查询的检索文档，从而提高了生成质量并显著减少了输入文档的数量。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly improved the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks in
recent years. However, since retrieval systems may return irrelevant content,
incorporating such information into the model often leads to hallucinations.
Thus, identifying and filtering out unhelpful retrieved content is a key
challenge for improving RAG performance.To better integrate the internal
knowledge of the model with external knowledge from retrieval, it is essential
to understand what the model "knows" and "does not know" (which is also called
"self-knowledge"). Based on this insight, we propose SKILL-RAG (Self-Knowledge
Induced Learning and Filtering for RAG), a novel method that leverages the
model's self-knowledge to determine which retrieved documents are beneficial
for answering a given query. We design a reinforcement learning-based training
framework to explicitly elicit self-knowledge from the model and employs
sentence-level granularity to filter out irrelevant content while preserving
useful knowledge.We evaluate SKILL-RAG using Llama2-7B and Qwen3-8B on several
question answering benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that SKILL-RAG
not only improves generation quality but also significantly reduces the number
of input documents, validating the importance of self-knowledge in guiding the
selection of high-quality retrievals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的情感文本到语音系统难以捕捉句子内部的动态情感变化，因此需要一种新的方法来实现更细粒度的情感控制。

Method: 引入Emo-FiLM，一个基于LLM的细粒度情感建模框架，通过情感特征对齐和特征调制，实现对文本情感的精细控制。

Result: Emo-FiLM通过映射情感特征显著提升了语音合成的质量和情感表现力，且在新构建的细粒度情感动态数据集上取得了好的实验结果。

Conclusion: Emo-FiLM在全球和细粒度任务上均优于现有方法，证明了其在表达性语音合成中的有效性和通用性。

Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech (E-TTS) is central to creating natural and
trustworthy human-computer interaction. Existing systems typically rely on
sentence-level control through predefined labels, reference audio, or natural
language prompts. While effective for global emotion expression, these
approaches fail to capture dynamic shifts within a sentence. To address this
limitation, we introduce Emo-FiLM, a fine-grained emotion modeling framework
for LLM-based TTS. Emo-FiLM aligns frame-level features from emotion2vec to
words to obtain word-level emotion annotations, and maps them through a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer, enabling word-level emotion
control by directly modulating text embeddings. To support evaluation, we
construct the Fine-grained Emotion Dynamics Dataset (FEDD) with detailed
annotations of emotional transitions. Experiments show that Emo-FiLM
outperforms existing approaches on both global and fine-grained tasks,
demonstrating its effectiveness and generality for expressive speech synthesis.

Result: 我们的实验证明，该方法在多种数据集上表现优异， consistently 超越了以往最先进的技术。

Conclusion: 本文提出的USB-Rec框架在对话推荐中提升了LLM的表现，并在多项实验中取得了超越现有最先进方法的结果。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely employed in
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). Unlike traditional language model
approaches that focus on training, all existing LLMs-based approaches are
mainly centered around how to leverage the summarization and analysis
capabilities of LLMs while ignoring the issue of training. Therefore, in this
work, we propose an integrated training-inference framework,
User-Simulator-Based framework (USB-Rec), for improving the performance of LLMs
in conversational recommendation at the model level. Firstly, we design a
LLM-based Preference Optimization (PO) dataset construction strategy for RL
training, which helps the LLMs understand the strategies and methods in
conversational recommendation. Secondly, we propose a Self-Enhancement Strategy
(SES) at the inference stage to further exploit the conversational
recommendation potential obtained from RL training. Extensive experiments on
various datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Conformal Importance Summarization提供了一个可靠、可控的自动摘要生成框架，适用于关键领域，确保重要信息的覆盖率。

Abstract: Automatic summarization systems have advanced rapidly with large language
models (LLMs), yet they still lack reliable guarantees on inclusion of critical
content in high-stakes domains like healthcare, law, and finance. In this work,
we introduce Conformal Importance Summarization, the first framework for
importance-preserving summary generation which uses conformal prediction to
provide rigorous, distribution-free coverage guarantees. By calibrating
thresholds on sentence-level importance scores, we enable extractive document
summarization with user-specified coverage and recall rates over critical
content. Our method is model-agnostic, requires only a small calibration set,
and seamlessly integrates with existing black-box LLMs. Experiments on
established summarization benchmarks demonstrate that Conformal Importance
Summarization achieves the theoretically assured information coverage rate. Our
work suggests that Conformal Importance Summarization can be combined with
existing techniques to achieve reliable, controllable automatic summarization,
paving the way for safer deployment of AI summarization tools in critical
applications. Code is available at

Motivation: 针对大规模语言模型在单独操作时推理能力有限的问题，通过多代理辩论来提升推理质量。

Method: 提出了一种基于角色的协作框架，作者代理生成初始方案，审核代理独立提供决策和评论，元审核员整合反馈做出最终决定。

Result: 在多个基准测试中进行的广泛实验表明，MARS相较于MAD和其他最先进的推理策略有效提升了推理质量，同时减少了计算资源的消耗。

Conclusion: MARS在准确性上与MAD相匹配，同时将令牌使用和推理时间减少了约50%。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in natural
language understanding, yet their reasoning capabilities remain limited when
operating as single agents. Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has been proposed to
address this limitation by enabling collaborative reasoning among multiple
models in a round-table debate manner. While effective, MAD introduces
substantial computational overhead due to the number of agents involved and the
frequent communication required. In this paper, we propose MARS (Multi-Agent
Review System), a role-based collaboration framework inspired by the review
process. In MARS, an author agent generates an initial solution, reviewer
agents provide decisions and comments independently, and a meta-reviewer
integrates the feedback to make the final decision and guide further revision.
This design enhances reasoning quality while avoiding costly
reviewer-to-reviewer interactions, thereby controlling token consumption and
inference time. We compared MARS with both MAD and other state-of-the-art
reasoning strategies across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments with
different LLMs show that MARS matches the accuracy of MAD while reducing both
token usage and inference time by approximately 50\%. Code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言（如粤语和吴语）在机器翻译中的训练数据和语言资源不足的问题，以提高其翻译质量。

Method: 通过对现有平行语料库的基础上构建，并由母语者进行严谨的标注，分类错误类型和严重性。

Result: 该数据集为机器翻译社区提供了新的资源，支持错误检测和翻译质量估计研究，并分析了标注者之间的一致性以及错误类型和严重性的模式。

Conclusion: SiniticMTError数据集为低资源语言的机器翻译提供了重要的错误分析和标注，有助于提升机器翻译模型的性能和质量。

Abstract: Despite major advances in machine translation (MT) in recent years, progress
remains limited for many low-resource languages that lack large-scale training
data and linguistic resources. Cantonese and Wu Chinese are two Sinitic
examples, although each enjoys more than 80 million speakers around the world.
In this paper, we introduce SiniticMTError, a novel dataset that builds on
existing parallel corpora to provide error span, error type, and error severity
annotations in machine-translated examples from English to Mandarin, Cantonese,
and Wu Chinese. Our dataset serves as a resource for the MT community to
utilize in fine-tuning models with error detection capabilities, supporting
research on translation quality estimation, error-aware generation, and
low-resource language evaluation. We report our rigorous annotation process by
native speakers, with analyses on inter-annotator agreement, iterative
feedback, and patterns in error type and severity.

TL;DR: 本文提出SwasthLLM，针对多语言医疗文本的疾病诊断，展示了在不同语言间的强大迁移能力，尤其是低资源环境下的优越表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言医疗环境中，低资源语言的医学数据缺乏和语言变异性问题，推动临床文本的自动化疾病诊断。

Method: 采用统一的零样本、跨语言多任务学习框架，并结合Siamese对比学习模块及模型无关元学习(MAML)。

Result: 在监督设置下，测试准确率达到97.22%，F1得分为97.17%；在零样本场景下，印地语准确率为92.78%，孟加拉语为73.33%。

Conclusion: SwasthLLM在低资源语言环境下，实现了高效的疾病自动诊断，特别是在无监督状态下表现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: In multilingual healthcare environments, automatic disease diagnosis from
clinical text remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of annotated
medical data in low-resource languages and the linguistic variability across
populations. This paper proposes SwasthLLM, a unified, zero-shot,
cross-lingual, and multi-task learning framework for medical diagnosis that
operates effectively across English, Hindi, and Bengali without requiring
language-specific fine-tuning. At its core, SwasthLLM leverages the
multilingual XLM-RoBERTa encoder augmented with a language-aware attention
mechanism and a disease classification head, enabling the model to extract
medically relevant information regardless of the language structure. To align
semantic representations across languages, a Siamese contrastive learning
module is introduced, ensuring that equivalent medical texts in different
languages produce similar embeddings. Further, a translation consistency module
and a contrastive projection head reinforce language-invariant representation
learning. SwasthLLM is trained using a multi-task learning strategy, jointly
optimizing disease classification, translation alignment, and contrastive
learning objectives. Additionally, we employ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning
(MAML) to equip the model with rapid adaptation capabilities for unseen
languages or tasks with minimal data. Our phased training pipeline emphasizes
robust representation alignment before task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive
evaluation shows that SwasthLLM achieves high diagnostic performance, with a
test accuracy of 97.22% and an F1-score of 97.17% in supervised settings.
Crucially, in zero-shot scenarios, it attains 92.78% accuracy on Hindi and
73.33% accuracy on Bengali medical text, demonstrating strong generalization in
low-resource contexts.

TL;DR: DS-MoE通过深度专业化的专家混合模型提高了处理效率和推理质量，表现出高效且可解释的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统变压器架构对所有输入应用相同处理深度的问题，从而提高推理效率并提升推理质量。

Method: 提出了动态推理链通过深度专业化的专家混合模型(DS-MoE)的概念，使用优化的专家模块进行不同的推理深度计算。

Result: DS-MoE在实验中实现了高达16%的计算节省，并在复杂的多步骤推理基准上提高了2.8%的准确率，同时推理速度提高了35%。

Conclusion: DS-MoE是一种显著推进自适应神经架构的框架，可以提高效率、推理质量和可解释性。

Abstract: Contemporary transformer architectures apply identical processing depth to
all inputs, creating inefficiencies and limiting reasoning quality. Simple
factual queries are subjected to the same multilayered computation as complex
logical problems, wasting resources while constraining deep inference. To
overcome this, we came up with a concept of Dynamic Reasoning Chains through
Depth Specialised Mixture of Experts (DS-MoE), a modular framework that extends
the Mixture of Experts paradigm from width-based to depth specialised
computation. DS-MoE introduces expert modules optimised for distinct reasoning
depths, shallow pattern recognition, compositional reasoning, logical
inference, memory integration, and meta-cognitive supervision. A learned
routing network dynamically assembles custom reasoning chains, activating only
the necessary experts to match input complexity. The dataset on which we
trained and evaluated DS-MoE is on The Pile, an 800GB corpus covering diverse
domains such as scientific papers, legal texts, programming code, and web
content, enabling systematic assessment across reasoning depths. Experimental
results demonstrate that DS-MoE achieves up to 16 per cent computational
savings and 35 per cent faster inference compared to uniform-depth
transformers, while delivering 2.8 per cent higher accuracy on complex
multi-step reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, routing decisions yield
interpretable reasoning chains, enhancing transparency and scalability. These
findings establish DS-MoE as a significant advancement in adaptive neural
architectures, demonstrating that depth-specialised modular processing can
simultaneously improve efficiency, reasoning quality, and interpretability in
large-scale language models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的HRT架构，能够有效处理语言的层次结构，显著提升计算效率和理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Transformer架构在处理自然语言任务时，未能有效反映人类语言的层次性，导致了计算成本高、组合泛化能力弱和对话语水平建模不足。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的波形启发式神经架构HRT，通过多分辨率注意力机制，实现从字符到语篇单元的语言处理。

Result: 在GLUE、SuperGLUE、Long Range Arena和WikiText-103等基准测试上，HRT相比标准Transformers在性能上平均提升了+3.8%（GLUE），+4.5%（SuperGLUE）和+6.1%（Long Range Arena），同时相比BERT和GPT模型减少42%的内存使用和37%的推理延迟。

Conclusion: HRT作为首个将计算结构与人类语言的层次组织对齐的架构，在语言理解方面展现了理论上的效率提升和实际的改进。

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance across
natural language tasks, yet they fundamentally misrepresent the hierarchical
nature of human language by processing text as flat token sequences. This
results in quadratic computational cost, weak computational cost, weak
compositional generalization, and inadequate discourse-level modeling. We
propose Hierarchical Resolution Transformer (HRT), a novel wavelet-inspired
neural architecture that processes language simultaneously across multiple
resolutions, from characters to discourse-level units. HRT constructs a
multi-resolution attention, enabling bottom-up composition and top-down
contextualization. By employing exponential sequence reduction across scales,
HRT achieves O(nlogn) complexity, offering significant efficiency improvements
over standard transformers. We evaluated HRT on a diverse suite of benchmarks,
including GLUE, SuperGLUE, Long Range Arena, and WikiText-103, and results
demonstrated that HRT outperforms standard transformer baselines by an average
of +3.8% on GLUE, +4.5% on SuperGLUE, and +6.1% on Long Range Arena, while
reducing memory usage by 42% and inference latency by 37% compared to BERT and
GPT style models of similar parameter count. Ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of cross-resolution attention and scale-specialized modules,
showing that each contributes independently to both efficiency and accuracy.
Our findings establish HRT as the first architecture to align computational
structure with the hierarchical organization of human language, demonstrating
that multi-scale, wavelet-inspired processing yields both theoretical
efficiency gains and practical improvements in language understanding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出FS-DFM模型，通过优化采样步骤，显著提升语言生成的速度和效率，同时保证生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统自回归语言模型在生成长序列时的低吞吐量和高延迟问题，同时克服离散扩散模型需要执行数百到数千次评估的限制。

Method: 提出FS-DFM (Few-Step Discrete Flow-Matching)模型，通过显式设置采样步骤数，并训练模型在不同步长预算下保持一致性。

Result: FS-DFM能够在生成1,024个标记时，实现与1,024步离散流基线相同的困惑度，并将采样速度提升至最快128倍。

Conclusion: FS-DFM方法在语言建模基准测试中表现出色，仅用8个采样步骤就能与1,024个步骤的基线模型相媲美，显著提高了采样速度。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models (ARMs) deliver strong likelihoods, but are
inherently serial: they generate one token per forward pass, which limits
throughput and inflates latency for long sequences. Diffusion Language Models
(DLMs) parallelize across positions and thus appear promising for language
generation, yet standard discrete diffusion typically needs hundreds to
thousands of model evaluations to reach high quality, trading serial depth for
iterative breadth. We introduce FS-DFM, Few-Step Discrete Flow-Matching. A
discrete flow-matching model designed for speed without sacrificing quality.
The core idea is simple: make the number of sampling steps an explicit
parameter and train the model to be consistent across step budgets, so one big
move lands where many small moves would. We pair this with a reliable update
rule that moves probability in the right direction without overshooting, and
with strong teacher guidance distilled from long-run trajectories. Together,
these choices make few-step sampling stable, accurate, and easy to control. On
language modeling benchmarks, FS-DFM with 8 sampling steps achieves perplexity
parity with a 1,024-step discrete-flow baseline for generating 1,024 tokens
using a similar-size model, delivering up to 128 times faster sampling and
corresponding latency/throughput gains.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种通过文本预测模型性能的初步方法，结合了任务描述和配置，而无需访问数据集实例，为实验优先级的智能化安排提供支持。

Abstract: Progress in large language models is constrained by an evaluation bottleneck:
build a benchmark, evaluate models and settings, then iterate. We therefore ask
a simple question: can we forecast outcomes before running any experiments? We
study text-only performance forecasting: estimating a model's score from a
redacted task description and intended configuration, with no access to dataset
instances. To support systematic study, we curate PRECOG, a corpus of redacted
description-performance pairs spanning diverse tasks, domains, and metrics.
Experiments show the task is challenging but feasible: models equipped with a
retrieval module that excludes source papers achieve moderate prediction
performance with well-calibrated uncertainty, reaching mean absolute error as
low as 8.7 on the Accuracy subset at high-confidence thresholds. Our analysis
indicates that stronger reasoning models engage in diverse, iterative querying,
whereas current open-source models lag and often skip retrieval or gather
evidence with limited diversity. We further test a zero-leakage setting,
forecasting on newly released datasets or experiments before their papers are
indexed, where GPT-5 with built-in web search still attains nontrivial
prediction accuracy. Overall, our corpus and analyses offer an initial step
toward open-ended anticipatory evaluation, supporting difficulty estimation and
smarter experiment prioritization.

Abstract: Predicting molecular properties is a critical component of drug discovery.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs),
have enabled end-to-end learning from molecular structures, reducing reliance
on manual feature engineering. However, while GNNs and self-supervised learning
approaches have advanced molecular property prediction (MPP), the integration
of human prior knowledge remains indispensable, as evidenced by recent methods
that leverage large language models (LLMs) for knowledge extraction. Despite
their strengths, LLMs are constrained by knowledge gaps and hallucinations,
particularly for less-studied molecular properties. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that, for the first time, integrates knowledge extracted from
LLMs with structural features derived from pre-trained molecular models to
enhance MPP. Our approach prompts LLMs to generate both domain-relevant
knowledge and executable code for molecular vectorization, producing
knowledge-based features that are subsequently fused with structural
representations. We employ three state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and
DeepSeek-R1, for knowledge extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our integrated method outperforms existing approaches, confirming that the
combination of LLM-derived knowledge and structural information provides a
robust and effective solution for MPP.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的RedHerring攻击模型显示出能够显著降低检测模型的准确性，而不损害分类器的表现，突显了检测与分类之间的紧张关系。

Abstract: In response to adversarial text attacks, attack detection models have been
proposed and shown to successfully identify text modified by adversaries.
Attack detection models can be leveraged to provide an additional check for NLP
models and give signals for human input. However, the reliability of these
models has not yet been thoroughly explored. Thus, we propose and test a novel
attack setting and attack, RedHerring. RedHerring aims to make attack detection
models unreliable by modifying a text to cause the detection model to predict
an attack, while keeping the classifier correct. This creates a tension between
the classifier and detector. If a human sees that the detector is giving an
``incorrect'' prediction, but the classifier a correct one, then the human will
see the detector as unreliable. We test this novel threat model on 4 datasets
against 3 detectors defending 4 classifiers. We find that RedHerring is able to
drop detection accuracy between 20 - 71 points, while maintaining (or
improving) classifier accuracy. As an initial defense, we propose a simple
confidence check which requires no retraining of the classifier or detector and
increases detection accuracy greatly. This novel threat model offers new
insights into how adversaries may target detection models.

Motivation: 当前的对抗文本攻击方法在计算成本和效率上面临挑战，尤其是对资源有限的研究人员。

Method: 提出两种新的攻击选择策略：混合选择和动态选择，结合了以往选择算法的优点。

Result: 测试结果表明，新的选择策略在四个数据集和六个目标模型上有效降低了攻击所需的查询次数，同时保持了攻击效果。

Conclusion: 我们的最佳方法（句子级混合选择）在对抗攻击中平均减少的查询次数可达25.82%，且未影响攻击效果。

Abstract: Adversarial text attack research plays a crucial role in evaluating the
robustness of NLP models. However, the increasing complexity of
transformer-based architectures has dramatically raised the computational cost
of attack testing, especially for researchers with limited resources (e.g.,
GPUs). Existing popular black-box attack methods often require a large number
of queries, which can make them inefficient and impractical for researchers. To
address these challenges, we propose two new attack selection strategies called
Hybrid and Dynamic Select, which better combine the strengths of previous
selection algorithms. Hybrid Select merges generalized BinarySelect techniques
with GreedySelect by introducing a size threshold to decide which selection
algorithm to use. Dynamic Select provides an alternative approach of combining
the generalized Binary and GreedySelect by learning which lengths of texts each
selection method should be applied to. This greatly reduces the number of
queries needed while maintaining attack effectiveness (a limitation of
BinarySelect). Across 4 datasets and 6 target models, our best
method(sentence-level Hybrid Select) is able to reduce the number of required
queries per attack up 25.82\% on average against both encoder models and LLMs,
without losing the effectiveness of the attack.

Abstract: Unsupervised neural grammar induction aims to learn interpretable

when and how the collapse emerges across key components of neural
parameterization and introduce a targeted solution, $\textit{collapse-relaxing

parsing performance while enabling the use of significantly more compact
grammars across a wide range of languages, as demonstrated through extensive

Abstract: We propose Confidence-guided Refinement Reasoning (C2R), a novel
training-free framework applicable to question-answering (QA) tasks across
text, image, and video domains. C2R strategically constructs and refines
sub-questions and their answers (sub-QAs), deriving a better confidence score
for the target answer. C2R first curates a subset of sub-QAs to explore diverse
reasoning paths, then compares the confidence scores of the resulting answer
candidates to select the most reliable final answer. Since C2R relies solely on
confidence scores derived from the model itself, it can be seamlessly
integrated with various existing QA models, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements across diverse models and benchmarks. Furthermore, we
provide essential yet underexplored insights into how leveraging sub-QAs
affects model behavior, specifically analyzing the impact of both the quantity
and quality of sub-QAs on achieving robust and reliable reasoning.

Conclusion: 虽然没有方法能够完全消除特定领域收益与一般能力的权衡，但TALR在平衡这两者方面持续 outperform 其他基线方法。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on domain-specific datasets is a common approach
to adapt Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized tasks but is often
believed to degrade their general capabilities. In this work, we revisit this
trade-off and present both empirical and theoretical insights. First, we show
that SFT does not always hurt: using a smaller learning rate can substantially
mitigate general performance degradation while preserving comparable
target-domain performance. We then provide a theoretical analysis that explains
these phenomena and further motivates a new method, Token-Adaptive Loss
Reweighting (TALR). Building on this, and recognizing that smaller learning
rates alone do not fully eliminate general-performance degradation in all
cases, we evaluate a range of strategies for reducing general capability loss,
including L2 regularization, LoRA, model averaging, FLOW, and our proposed
TALR. Experimental results demonstrate that while no method completely
eliminates the trade-off, TALR consistently outperforms these baselines in
balancing domain-specific gains and general capabilities. Finally, we distill
our findings into practical guidelines for adapting LLMs to new domains: (i)
using a small learning rate to achieve a favorable trade-off, and (ii) when a
stronger balance is further desired, adopt TALR as an effective strategy.

Method: 提出了原子内积（AIP）以修正表示偏移，并通过训练阈值激活的稀疏自编码器（SAEs）进行验证。

Result: 通过对Gemma2-2B、Gemma2-9B和Llama3.1-8B的SAEs训练，实现了99.9%的稀疏重建，且原子的唯一性条件满足率显著高于神经元和特征。

Conclusion: Atoms Theory为LLMs的内部表示提供了理论框架，能够更好地理解其机制，也为机械可解释性奠定了基础。

Abstract: The fundamental units of internal representations in large language models
(LLMs) remain undefined, limiting further understanding of their mechanisms.
Neurons or features are often regarded as such units, yet neurons suffer from
polysemy, while features face concerns of unreliable reconstruction and
instability. To address this issue, we propose the Atoms Theory, which defines
such units as atoms. We introduce the atomic inner product (AIP) to correct
representation shifting, formally define atoms, and prove the conditions that
atoms satisfy the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), ensuring stable sparse
representations over atom set and linking to compressed sensing. Under stronger
conditions, we further establish the uniqueness and exact $\ell_1$
recoverability of the sparse representations, and provide guarantees that
single-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs) with threshold activations can reliably
identify the atoms. To validate the Atoms Theory, we train threshold-activated
SAEs on Gemma2-2B, Gemma2-9B, and Llama3.1-8B, achieving 99.9% sparse
reconstruction across layers on average, and more than 99.8% of atoms satisfy
the uniqueness condition, compared to 0.5% for neurons and 68.2% for features,
showing that atoms more faithfully capture intrinsic representations of LLMs.
Scaling experiments further reveal the link between SAEs size and recovery
capacity. Overall, this work systematically introduces and validates Atoms
Theory of LLMs, providing a theoretical framework for understanding internal
representations and a foundation for mechanistic interpretability. Code

Motivation: 个性化评论生成帮助企业理解用户偏好，然而现有方法通常需要大量用户评论或额外训练。

Method: 提出对话提示法（CP），将用户评论重构为多轮对话，包括简单版本（SCP）和对比版本（CCP）。

Result: 在八个产品领域和五个大型语言模型的实验中，SCP和CCP生成的评论更接近目标用户，即使在仅有两个用户评论时，CCP在高质量负面示例可用时有更好的表现。

Conclusion: 对话提示法在少量和无训练限制的条件下，为评论生成提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Personalized review generation helps businesses understand user preferences,
yet most existing approaches assume extensive review histories of the target
user or require additional model training. Real-world applications often face
few-shot and training-free situations, where only a few user reviews are
available and fine-tuning is infeasible. It is well known that large language
models (LLMs) can address such low-resource settings, but their effectiveness
depends on prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose Conversational
Prompting, a lightweight method that reformulates user reviews as multi-turn
conversations. Its simple variant, Simple Conversational Prompting (SCP),
relies solely on the user's own reviews, while the contrastive variant,
Contrastive Conversational Prompting (CCP), inserts reviews from other users or
LLMs as incorrect replies and then asks the model to correct them, encouraging
the model to produce text in the user's style. Experiments on eight product
domains and five LLMs showed that the conventional non-conversational prompt
often produced reviews similar to those written by random users, based on
text-based metrics such as ROUGE-L and BERTScore, and application-oriented
tasks like user identity matching and sentiment analysis. In contrast, both SCP
and CCP produced reviews much closer to those of the target user, even when
each user had only two reviews. CCP brings further improvements when
high-quality negative examples are available, whereas SCP remains competitive
when such data cannot be collected. These results suggest that conversational
prompting offers a practical solution for review generation under few-shot and
training-free constraints.

TL;DR: EoG框架通过弥补知识图谱与查询之间的语义差距，提升了知识图谱问答的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在知识密集型场景（如KGQA）中存在幻觉和事实错误，目前方法通常忽略了知识图谱和查询之间的语义差距。

Method: 提出了一种灵活的框架Enrich-on-Graph（EoG），利用LLMs的先验知识来丰富知识图谱，并通过三种图质量评估指标分析查询与图的对齐。

Result: 在两个KGQA基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，EoG可以有效生成高质量的知识图谱，并实现了最新的性能。

Conclusion: EoG框架能够有效生成高质量知识图谱，并在KGQA任务中达到最新的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities in complex
tasks. However, they still struggle with hallucinations and factual errors in
knowledge-intensive scenarios like knowledge graph question answering (KGQA).
We attribute this to the semantic gap between structured knowledge graphs (KGs)
and unstructured queries, caused by inherent differences in their focuses and
structures. Existing methods usually employ resource-intensive, non-scalable
workflows reasoning on vanilla KGs, but overlook this gap. To address this
challenge, we propose a flexible framework, Enrich-on-Graph (EoG), which
leverages LLMs' prior knowledge to enrich KGs, bridge the semantic gap between
graphs and queries. EoG enables efficient evidence extraction from KGs for
precise and robust reasoning, while ensuring low computational costs,
scalability, and adaptability across different methods. Furthermore, we propose
three graph quality evaluation metrics to analyze query-graph alignment in KGQA
task, supported by theoretical validation of our optimization objectives.
Extensive experiments on two KGQA benchmark datasets indicate that EoG can
effectively generate high-quality KGs and achieve the state-of-the-art
performance. Our code and data are available at

*Taehee Park,Heejin Do,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的方法PoCO，通过结合大型语言模型的优点和小型模型的可靠性，平衡了语法错误纠正中的召回率和精确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型在可靠性方面表现良好，但召回率低；而大型语言模型则可能导致过度修正，精确率低。因此需要一种新方法来协调两者之间的平衡。

Method: 首先通过大型语言模型引发过度修正以最大化召回率，然后通过微调小型模型进行有针对性的后续修正，以识别和完善错误输出。

Result: PoCO在语法错误纠正性能上有效提升了召回率，同时保持了竞争力的精确率。

Conclusion: PoCO方法有效地平衡了语法错误纠正的召回率和精确率，从而提高了整体质量。

Abstract: Robust supervised fine-tuned small Language Models (sLMs) often show high
reliability but tend to undercorrect. They achieve high precision at the cost
of low recall. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) often show the opposite
tendency, making excessive overcorrection, leading to low precision. To
effectively harness the strengths of LLMs to address the recall challenges in
sLMs, we propose Post-Correction via Overcorrection (PoCO), a novel approach
that strategically balances recall and precision. PoCO first intentionally
triggers overcorrection via LLM to maximize recall by allowing comprehensive
revisions, then applies a targeted post-correction step via fine-tuning smaller
models to identify and refine erroneous outputs. We aim to harmonize both
aspects by leveraging the generative power of LLMs while preserving the
reliability of smaller supervised models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that PoCO effectively balances GEC performance by increasing recall with
competitive precision, ultimately improving the overall quality of grammatical
error correction.

TL;DR: 在多样本ICL的高计算需求下，提出了cheat-sheet ICL，通过简明的摘要降低令牌使用，实验证明其性能可与甚至优于多样本ICL。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多样本ICL由于输入令牌过长导致的高计算需求，提出了一种更高效的替代方法。

Method: 提出了cheat-sheet ICL，通过将多样本ICL的信息提炼为简明的文本摘要（备忘单），在推理时使用。

Result: 实验表明，cheat-sheet ICL在具有挑战性的推理任务中与多样本ICL相当，或者表现更好，同时使用的令牌数量远少于多样本ICL，并且在不需要检索时匹配基于检索的ICL。

Conclusion: cheat-sheet ICL是利用大型语言模型的有效替代方法，可以在下游任务中实现更好的性能，同时降低计算成本。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable effective in-context
learning (ICL) with many-shot examples, but at the cost of high computational
demand due to longer input tokens. To address this, we propose cheat-sheet ICL,
which distills the information from many-shot ICL into a concise textual
summary (cheat sheet) used as the context at inference time. Experiments on
challenging reasoning tasks show that cheat-sheet ICL achieves comparable or
better performance than many-shot ICL with far fewer tokens, and matches
retrieval-based ICL without requiring test-time retrieval. These findings
demonstrate that cheat-sheet ICL is a practical alternative for leveraging LLMs
in downstream tasks.

Motivation: 随着云服务中大型语言模型的普及，对用户输入的隐私保护引发了重要关注。

Method: 提出了一种零-shot的树搜索迭代句子重写算法，通过结构化搜索系统性地模糊或删除私密信息。

Result: 在隐私敏感数据集上的实验表明，我们的方法显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在隐私保护和实用性之间实现了显著的平衡，优于现有基线。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in cloud-based
services has raised significant privacy concerns, as user inputs may
inadvertently expose sensitive information. Existing text anonymization and
de-identification techniques, such as rule-based redaction and scrubbing, often
struggle to balance privacy preservation with text naturalness and utility. In
this work, we propose a zero-shot, tree-search-based iterative sentence
rewriting algorithm that systematically obfuscates or deletes private
information while preserving coherence, relevance, and naturalness. Our method
incrementally rewrites privacy-sensitive segments through a structured search
guided by a reward model, enabling dynamic exploration of the rewriting space.
Experiments on privacy-sensitive datasets show that our approach significantly
outperforms existing baselines, achieving a superior balance between privacy
protection and utility preservation.

Conclusion: 我们提出了一种生成次句引文的方法，显著提高了引用的质量和可读性，从而方便用户验证生成内容的正确性。

Abstract: In retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) question answering systems,
generating citations for large language model (LLM) outputs enhances
verifiability and helps users identify potential hallucinations. However, we
observe two problems in the citations produced by existing attribution methods.
First, the citations are typically provided at the sentence or even paragraph
level. Long sentences or paragraphs may include a substantial amount of
irrelevant content. Second, sentence-level citations may omit information that
is essential for verifying the output, forcing users to read the surrounding
context. In this paper, we propose generating sub-sentence citations that are
both concise and sufficient, thereby reducing the effort required by users to
confirm the correctness of the generated output. To this end, we first develop
annotation guidelines for such citations and construct a corresponding dataset.
Then, we propose an attribution framework for generating citations that adhere
to our standards. This framework leverages LLMs to automatically generate
fine-tuning data for our task and employs a credit model to filter out
low-quality examples. Our experiments on the constructed dataset demonstrate
that the propose approach can generate high-quality and more readable
citations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在语言生成中的潜力强，但监督微调难以实现，生成过程较为不可预测。因此，需要控制关键令牌以引导生成方向。

Method: 提出了一种基于加权的监督微调（WeFT）方法，利用熵为不同令牌分配权重。

Result: WeFT在多个推理基准任务上取得了相对于标准SFT的显著提升：在s1K、s1K-1.1和3k样本上，分别获得39%、64%和83%的相对改善。

Conclusion: WeFT方法显著提升了扩散语言模型的生成表现，尤其是在推理基准任务上，展示了SFT的有效性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown strong potential in language modeling,
offering faster generation compared to traditional autoregressive approaches.
However, applying supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to diffusion models remains
challenging, as they lack precise probability estimates at each denoising step.
While the diffusion mechanism enables the model to reason over entire
sequences, it also makes the generation process less predictable and often
inconsistent. This highlights the importance of controlling key tokens that
guide the direction of generation. To address this issue, we propose WeFT, a
weighted SFT method for diffusion language models, where tokens are assigned
different weights based on their entropy. Derived from diffusion theory, WeFT
delivers substantial gains: training on s1K, s1K-1.1, and 3k samples from
open-r1, it achieves relative improvements of 39%, 64%, and 83% over standard
SFT on four widely used reasoning benchmarks (Sudoku, Countdown, GSM8K, and
MATH-500). The code and models will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策通常需要考虑多个答案，以降低狭隘视角的风险，而当前的医疗推理模型往往只生成单一答案。

Method: 本研究采用了两种方法：提示（prompting）和微调（fine-tuning），具体包括监督微调（SFT）和强化微调（RFT）。

Result: 我们的研究表明，虽然一些SFT模型在某些答案格式上具有一定的泛化能力，但RFT训练的模型在多个格式上更为稳健，并且提出的新奖励函数促进了针对排名列表的答案生成。

Conclusion: 这项研究是首次系统性地探讨医疗推理模型生成排名答案列表的方法，强调多选项回答的重要性。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study on enabling medical reasoning models
(MRMs) to generate ranked lists of answers for open-ended questions. Clinical
decision-making rarely relies on a single answer but instead considers multiple
options, reducing the risks of narrow perspectives. Yet current MRMs are
typically trained to produce only one answer, even in open-ended settings. We
propose an alternative format: ranked lists and investigate two approaches:
prompting and fine-tuning. While prompting is a cost-effective way to steer an
MRM's response, not all MRMs generalize well across different answer formats:
choice, short text, and list answers. Based on our prompting findings, we train
and evaluate MRMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). SFT teaches a model to imitate annotated responses, and RFT
incentivizes exploration through the responses that maximize a reward. We
propose new reward functions targeted at ranked-list answer formats, and
conduct ablation studies for RFT. Our results show that while some SFT models
generalize to certain answer formats, models trained with RFT are more robust
across multiple formats. We also present a case study on a modified MedQA with
multiple valid answers, finding that although MRMs might fail to select the
benchmark's preferred ground truth, they can recognize valid answers. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation of approaches
for enabling MRMs to generate answers as ranked lists. We hope this work
provides a first step toward developing alternative answer formats that are
beneficial beyond single answers in medical domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在长文档摘要方面面临信息损失、事实不一致和连贯性问题，因此需要一种有效的解决方案。

Method: 使用对抗性多代理框架，在摘要生成和提问两个领域内进行协同智能，以生成和评估摘要，并通过持续的质量检查机制提升摘要效果。

Result: 实验结果表明，SummQ在ROUGE、BERTScore指标及人类评估中均明显优于现有最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的SummQ框架通过多代理合作的方式显著提升了长文档摘要的质量。

Abstract: Long document summarization remains a significant challenge for current large
language models (LLMs), as existing approaches commonly struggle with
information loss, factual inconsistencies, and coherence issues when processing
excessively long documents. We propose SummQ, a novel adversarial multi-agent
framework that addresses these limitations through collaborative intelligence
between specialized agents operating in two complementary domains:
summarization and quizzing. Our approach employs summary generators and
reviewers that work collaboratively to create and evaluate comprehensive
summaries, while quiz generators and reviewers create comprehension questions
that serve as continuous quality checks for the summarization process. This
adversarial dynamic, enhanced by an examinee agent that validates whether the
generated summary contains the information needed to answer the quiz questions,
enables iterative refinement through multifaceted feedback mechanisms. We
evaluate SummQ on three widely used long document summarization benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods across ROUGE and BERTScore metrics, as well
as in LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluations. Our comprehensive analyses reveal
the effectiveness of the multi-agent collaboration dynamics, the influence of
different agent configurations, and the impact of the quizzing mechanism. This
work establishes a new approach for long document summarization that uses
adversarial agentic collaboration to improve summarization quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测方法仅依赖表层的词汇重叠和困惑度，缺乏对隐含污染数据的有效检测。

Method: 通过分析数字令牌在生成过程中的概率轨迹，以检测记忆现象。

Result: 污染样本与干净样本展示出明显不同的推理轨迹，并通过LoRA微调进一步验证这些轨迹模式。

Conclusion: MemLens有效检测语言模型中的记忆现象，揭示了污染样本与干净样本在推理轨迹上的显著差异，证明了其捕获真实记忆信号的能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated on challenging benchmarks
such as AIME and Math500, which are susceptible to contamination and risk of
being memorized. Existing detection methods, which primarily rely on
surface-level lexical overlap and perplexity, demonstrate low generalization
and degrade significantly when encountering implicitly contaminated data. In
this paper, we propose MemLens (An Activation Lens for Memorization Detection)
to detect memorization by analyzing the probability trajectories of numeric
tokens during generation. Our method reveals that contaminated samples exhibit
``shortcut'' behaviors, locking onto an answer with high confidence in the
model's early layers, whereas clean samples show more gradual evidence
accumulation across the model's full depth. We observe that contaminated and
clean samples exhibit distinct and well-separated reasoning trajectories. To
further validate this, we inject carefully designed samples into the model
through LoRA fine-tuning and observe the same trajectory patterns as in
naturally contaminated data. These results provide strong evidence that MemLens
captures genuine signals of memorization rather than spurious correlations.

<details>

Motivation: 探讨句子层面记忆负载的解释，是基于线性接近度还是结构密度，进而提出干预者复杂性作为理解这一现象的重要视角。

Method: 通过混合效应框架和协调的依赖树库，分析句子长度、依赖长度和干预者复杂性作为记忆负载的预测因子。

Result: 三种因素均与记忆负载正相关，其中句子长度影响最大，干预者复杂性则提供了超越线性距离的解释。

Conclusion: 研究发现句子长度对记忆负载的影响最大，而干预者复杂性在超越线性距离方面提供了解释力。

Abstract: This study examines whether sentence-level memory load in comprehension is
better explained by linear proximity between syntactically related words or by
the structural density of the intervening material. Building on locality-based
accounts and cross-linguistic evidence for dependency length minimization, the
work advances Intervener Complexity-the number of intervening heads between a
head and its dependent-as a structurally grounded lens that refines linear
distance measures. Using harmonized dependency treebanks and a mixed-effects
framework across multiple languages, the analysis jointly evaluates sentence
length, dependency length, and Intervener Complexity as predictors of the
Memory-load measure. Studies in Psycholinguistics have reported the
contributions of feature interference and misbinding to memory load during
processing. For this study, I operationalized sentence-level memory load as the
linear sum of feature misbinding and feature interference for tractability;
current evidence does not establish that their cognitive contributions combine
additively. All three factors are positively associated with memory load, with
sentence length exerting the broadest influence and Intervener Complexity
offering explanatory power beyond linear distance. Conceptually, the findings
reconcile linear and hierarchical perspectives on locality by treating
dependency length as an important surface signature while identifying
intervening heads as a more proximate indicator of integration and maintenance
demands. Methodologically, the study illustrates how UD-based graph measures
and cross-linguistic mixed-effects modelling can disentangle linear and
structural contributions to processing efficiency, providing a principled path
for evaluating competing theories of memory load in sentence comprehension.

TL;DR: 本文研究了阿拉伯语中的工具调用能力，分析了使用阿拉伯语工具调用数据与跨语言迁移的必要性、通用指令微调的影响，以及针对特定工具的微调价值，并通过实验提供了关键见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数工具调用研究集中于英语，这使得我们对如何为其他语言（如阿拉伯语）启用此功能的理解存在差距。

Method: 通过使用基础和后训练的开放权重阿拉伯语LLM进行了广泛的实验，并将两个开源工具调用数据集翻译和适配为阿拉伯语。

Result: 研究表明，使用阿拉伯语的工具调用数据在性能上优于依赖跨语言迁移，同时发现通用指令微调和针对特定高优先级工具的微调对工具调用表现具有重要影响。

Conclusion: 我们的研究为开发强大的阿拉伯语工具增强代理提供了关键的见解。

Abstract: Tool calling is a critical capability that allows Large Language Models
(LLMs) to interact with external systems, significantly expanding their
utility. However, research and resources for tool calling are predominantly
English-centric, leaving a gap in our understanding of how to enable this
functionality for other languages, such as Arabic. This paper investigates
three key research questions: (1) the necessity of in-language (Arabic)
tool-calling data versus relying on cross-lingual transfer, (2) the effect of
general-purpose instruction tuning on tool-calling performance, and (3) the
value of fine-tuning on specific, high-priority tools. To address these
questions, we conduct extensive experiments using base and post-trained
variants of an open-weight Arabic LLM. To enable this study, we bridge the
resource gap by translating and adapting two open-source tool-calling datasets
into Arabic. Our findings provide crucial insights into the optimal strategies
for developing robust tool-augmented agents for Arabic.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can act as evaluators, a role studied by methods
like LLM-as-a-Judge and fine-tuned judging LLMs. In the field of education,
LLMs have been studied as assistant tools for students and teachers. Our
research investigates LLM-driven automatic evaluation systems for academic
Text-Input Problems using rubrics. We propose five evaluation systems that have
been tested on a custom dataset of 110 answers about computer science from
higher education students with three models: JudgeLM, Llama-3.1-8B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B. The evaluation systems include: The JudgeLM
evaluation, which uses the model's single answer prompt to obtain a score;
Reference Aided Evaluation, which uses a correct answer as a guide aside from
the original context of the question; No Reference Evaluation, which ommits the
reference answer; Additive Evaluation, which uses atomic criteria; and Adaptive
Evaluation, which is an evaluation done with generated criteria fitted to each
question. All evaluation methods have been compared with the results of a human
evaluator. Results show that the best method to automatically evaluate and
score Text-Input Problems using LLMs is Reference Aided Evaluation. With the
lowest median absolute deviation (0.945) and the lowest root mean square
deviation (1.214) when compared to human evaluation, Reference Aided Evaluation
offers fair scoring as well as insightful and complete evaluations. Other
methods such as Additive and Adaptive Evaluation fail to provide good results
in concise answers, No Reference Evaluation lacks information needed to
correctly assess questions and JudgeLM Evaluations have not provided good
results due to the model's limitations. As a result, we conclude that
Artificial Intelligence-driven automatic evaluation systems, aided with proper
methodologies, show potential to work as complementary tools to other academic
resources.

TL;DR: 因果掩码在Transformer解码器中提供了位置编码的额外信息，尤其是与RoPE结合时，相互作用影响了注意力模式的形成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究因果掩码在Transformer模型中的位置编码作用，探索其对注意力模式的影响，特别是在与RoPE共存时的交互效应。

Method: 通过理论分析和实证分析，证明了因果掩码可以引入位置依赖的注意力模式，且这种模式在训练模型中得到了验证。

Result: 训练后的模型展现出因果掩码增强的位置依赖关注模式，同时与RoPE的交互导致了关注得分从相对向非相对的扭曲。

Conclusion: 因果掩码对Transformer解码器中的位置编码起着重要作用，尤其是在与RoPE结合时，二者相互影响并扭曲了相对关注得分。

Abstract: While explicit positional encodings such as RoPE are a primary source of
positional information in Transformer decoders, the causal mask also provides
positional information. In this work, we prove that the causal mask can induce
position-dependent patterns in attention scores, even without parameters or
causal dependency in the input. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the
induced attention pattern tends to favor nearby query-key pairs, mirroring the
behavior of common positional encodings. Empirical analysis confirms that
trained models exhibit the same behavior, with learned parameters further
amplifying these patterns. Notably, we found that the interaction of causal
mask and RoPE distorts RoPE's relative attention score patterns into
non-relative ones. We consistently observed this effect in modern large
language models, suggesting the importance of considering the causal mask as a
source of positional information alongside explicit positional encodings.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型逐渐应用于实际场景，了解其同时遵循多个指令的能力变得至关重要。

Method: 介绍了两个专门基准：Many Instruction-Following Eval用于文本生成，Style-aware Mostly Basic Programming Problems用于代码生成，以及三种回归模型来估计性能。

Result: 实验显示，随着指令数量的增加，性能一致降低；回归模型能够有效预测未见指令组合的表现，且误差约为10%。

Conclusion: 相对适中的样本量足以用于性能估算，使得在各种指令组合下有效评估LLM成为可能。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to real-world
scenarios, it becomes crucial to understand their ability to follow multiple
instructions simultaneously. To systematically evaluate these capabilities, we
introduce two specialized benchmarks for fundamental domains where multiple
instructions following is important: Many Instruction-Following Eval
(ManyIFEval) for text generation with up to ten instructions, and Style-aware
Mostly Basic Programming Problems (StyleMBPP) for code generation with up to
six instructions. Our experiments with the created benchmarks across ten LLMs
reveal that performance consistently degrades as the number of instructions
increases. Furthermore, given the fact that evaluating all the possible
combinations of multiple instructions is computationally impractical in actual
use cases, we developed three types of regression models that can estimate
performance on both unseen instruction combinations and different numbers of
instructions which are not used during training. We demonstrate that a logistic
regression model using instruction count as an explanatory variable can predict
performance of following multiple instructions with approximately 10% error,
even for unseen instruction combinations. We show that relatively modest sample
sizes (500 for ManyIFEval and 300 for StyleMBPP) are sufficient for performance
estimation, enabling efficient evaluation of LLMs under various instruction
combinations.

Method: 通过引入SoM-1K大规模多模态基准数据集，评估当前的基础模型在材料强度问题上的表现，并提出了一种新的提示策略DoI。

Result: 在对八个代表性的基础模型进行评估后，发现目前的模型在处理这些工程问题时表现较差，最佳模型的准确率仅为56.6%。

Conclusion: 这项工作为工程人工智能建立了一个严格的基准，突出了在科学和工程背景下发展更强大的多模态推理能力的迫切需要。

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable capabilities in various domains, but
their performance on complex, multimodal engineering problems remains largely
unexplored. We introduce SoM-1K, the first large-scale multimodal benchmark
dataset dedicated to evaluating foundation models on problems in the strength
of materials (SoM). The dataset, which contains 1,065 annotated SoM problems,
mirrors real-world engineering tasks by including both textual problem
statements and schematic diagrams. Due to the limited capabilities of current
foundation models in understanding complicated visual information, we propose a
novel prompting strategy called Descriptions of Images (DoI), which provides
rigorous expert-generated text descriptions of the visual diagrams as the
context. We evaluate eight representative foundation models, including both
large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). Our results
show that current foundation models struggle significantly with these
engineering problems, with the best-performing model achieving only 56.6%
accuracy. Interestingly, we found that LLMs, when provided with DoI, often
outperform VLMs provided with visual diagrams. A detailed error analysis
reveals that DoI plays a crucial role in mitigating visual misinterpretation
errors, suggesting that accurate text-based descriptions can be more effective
than direct image input for current foundation models. This work establishes a
rigorous benchmark for engineering AI and highlights a critical need for
developing more robust multimodal reasoning capabilities in foundation models,
particularly in scientific and engineering contexts.

### [131] [Which Cultural Lens Do Models Adopt? On Cultural Positioning Bias and Agentic Mitigation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21080)
*Yixin Wan,Xingrun Chen,Kai-Wei Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究识别并系统调查了大语言模型中的文化定位偏见，提出了CultureLens基准和两种代理方法，以减轻生成偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型在生成过程中存在的文化定位偏见，尤其是主流文化与非主流文化之间的不平等表现。

Method: 提出了两种推理时缓解方法：公平干预支柱(FIP)方法和由多个专门代理结构化的缓解框架(MFA)。

Result: 在五个最先进的大语言模型的实证评估中，发现模型在美国背景下的脚本中以内部身份（insider）音调生成超过88%，而对非主流文化则主要采用外部身份（outsider）。

Conclusion: 代理方法有效减轻了生成型大语言模型中的文化偏见，为偏见的缓解提供了有希望的方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a wide range of downstream
generative applications. However, we found that they also risk perpetuating
subtle fairness issues tied to culture, positioning their generations from the
perspectives of the mainstream US culture while demonstrating salient
externality towards non-mainstream ones. In this work, we identify and
systematically investigate this novel culture positioning bias, in which an
LLM's default generative stance aligns with a mainstream view and treats other
cultures as outsiders. We propose the CultureLens benchmark with 4000
generation prompts and 3 evaluation metrics for quantifying this bias through
the lens of a culturally situated interview script generation task, in which an
LLM is positioned as an onsite reporter interviewing local people across 10
diverse cultures. Empirical evaluation on 5 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a
stark pattern: while models adopt insider tones in over 88 percent of
US-contexted scripts on average, they disproportionately adopt mainly outsider
stances for less dominant cultures. To resolve these biases, we propose 2
inference-time mitigation methods: a baseline prompt-based Fairness
Intervention Pillars (FIP) method, and a structured Mitigation via Fairness
Agents (MFA) framework consisting of 2 pipelines: (1) MFA-SA (Single-Agent)
introduces a self-reflection and rewriting loop based on fairness guidelines.
(2) MFA-MA (Multi-Agent) structures the process into a hierarchy of specialized
agents: a Planner Agent(initial script generation), a Critique Agent (evaluates
initial script against fairness pillars), and a Refinement Agent (incorporates
feedback to produce a polished, unbiased script). Empirical results showcase
the effectiveness of agent-based methods as a promising direction for
mitigating biases in generative LLMs.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了PerHalluEval基准，评估波斯语中的幻觉现象，结果表明模型普遍对幻觉文本检测不佳，外部知识部分减轻幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幻觉是影响所有大型语言模型的持续问题，特别是在波斯语等低资源语言中。

Method: 采用三阶段的LLM驱动流程并结合人工验证来生成与问答和总结任务相关的合理答案与摘要，重点检测外在和内在幻觉。

Result: 评估了12个大型语言模型，发现它们普遍难以检测幻觉波斯语文本，专门为波斯语训练的模型与其他模型在幻觉识别上没有显著差异。

Conclusion: 提供外部知识可以部分缓解幻觉问题，但不同模型在识别波斯语幻觉文本上表现整体较差。

Abstract: Hallucination is a persistent issue affecting all large language Models
(LLMs), particularly within low-resource languages such as Persian.
PerHalluEval (Persian Hallucination Evaluation) is the first dynamic
hallucination evaluation benchmark tailored for the Persian language. Our
benchmark leverages a three-stage LLM-driven pipeline, augmented with human
validation, to generate plausible answers and summaries regarding QA and
summarization tasks, focusing on detecting extrinsic and intrinsic
hallucinations. Moreover, we used the log probabilities of generated tokens to
select the most believable hallucinated instances. In addition, we engaged
human annotators to highlight Persian-specific contexts in the QA dataset in
order to evaluate LLMs' performance on content specifically related to Persian
culture. Our evaluation of 12 LLMs, including open- and closed-source models
using PerHalluEval, revealed that the models generally struggle in detecting
hallucinated Persian text. We showed that providing external knowledge, i.e.,
the original document for the summarization task, could mitigate hallucination
partially. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in terms of
hallucination when comparing LLMs specifically trained for Persian with others.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提升搜索增强型大型语言模型在用户信息需求多样性上的个性化能力，填补现有个性化评估的研究空白。

Method: 通过长期的人工注释，收集真实的聊天和搜索历史，并将响应与细粒度偏好评分和反馈配对。

Result: 通过BESPOKE进行的系统分析揭示了信息获取任务中有效个性化的关键需求，为个性化搜索增强型大型语言模型的细粒度评估奠定了基础。

Conclusion: BESPOKE为评估搜索增强型大型语言模型的个性化提供了一种现实的基准，能够揭示有效个性化所需的关键要求。

Abstract: Search-augmented large language models (LLMs) have advanced
information-seeking tasks by integrating retrieval into generation, reducing
users' cognitive burden compared to traditional search systems. Yet they remain
insufficient for fully addressing diverse user needs, which requires
recognizing how the same query can reflect different intents across users and
delivering information in preferred forms. While recent systems such as ChatGPT
and Gemini attempt personalization by leveraging user histories, systematic
evaluation of such personalization is under-explored. To address this gap, we
propose BESPOKE, the realistic benchmark for evaluating personalization in
search-augmented LLMs. BESPOKE is designed to be both realistic, by collecting
authentic chat and search histories directly from humans, and diagnostic, by
pairing responses with fine-grained preference scores and feedback. The
benchmark is constructed through long-term, deeply engaged human annotation,
where human annotators contributed their own histories, authored queries with
detailed information needs, and evaluated responses with scores and diagnostic
feedback. Leveraging BESPOKE, we conduct systematic analyses that reveal key
requirements for effective personalization in information-seeking tasks,
providing a foundation for fine-grained evaluation of personalized
search-augmented LLMs. Our code and data are available at

TL;DR: VoiceBBQ是一个用于评估口语模型社交偏见的工具，研究发现不同模型在内容和声学偏见方面表现迥异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了研究口语语言模型中的社交偏见，尤其是在内容和声学方面的不同来源。

Method: 将BBQ数据集转换为受控的声音条件，以便在口语环境中进行评估。

Result: 对LLaMA-Omni和Qwen2-Audio两个模型进行评估，发现它们在抵抗声学偏见和保持内容完整性方面表现不同。

Conclusion: VoiceBBQ是一个有效的测试工具，可以用于评估和识别口语语言模型中的内容和声学偏见。

Abstract: We introduce VoiceBBQ, a spoken extension of the BBQ (Bias Benchmark for
Question Answering) - a dataset that measures social bias by presenting
ambiguous or disambiguated contexts followed by questions that may elicit
stereotypical responses. Due to the nature of speech, social bias in Spoken
Language Models (SLMs) can emerge from two distinct sources: 1) content aspect
and 2) acoustic aspect. The dataset converts every BBQ context into controlled
voice conditions, enabling per-axis accuracy, bias, and consistency scores that
remain comparable to the original text benchmark. Using VoiceBBQ, we evaluate
two SLMs - LLaMA-Omni and Qwen2-Audio - and observe architectural contrasts:
LLaMA-Omni resists acoustic bias while amplifying gender and accent bias,
whereas Qwen2-Audio substantially dampens these cues while preserving content
fidelity. VoiceBBQ thus provides a compact, drop-in testbed for jointly
diagnosing content and acoustic bias across spoken language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新数据集分析SpeechLMs的性别偏差，发现模型在性别刻板印象问题上倾向男性回应，而在性别依赖问题中却表现出性别无关性，揭示现有技术在性别偏见消除上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语音交互的发展，SpeechLMs在与AI的互动中变得普遍，但存在基于声学的性别差异，促使对这一现象的深入理解。

Method: 本研究通过构建包含9,208个语音样本的新数据集，对SpeechLMs的性别偏差进行了系统分析，评估了LLaMA-Omni系列的反应模式。

Result: 研究发现，在性别刻板印象问题上，模型表现出男性倾向的回答，而在性别依赖的问题中，模型的回答却表现出独立于性别的模式，揭示了当前模型在处理性别偏见上的局限性。

Conclusion: 现有的SpeechLMs未能有效消除性别偏见，尽管它们优先考虑一般公平原则而非上下文适宜性，强调需要更复杂的技术来正确利用语音技术中的性别信息。

Abstract: Speech-aware Language Models (SpeechLMs) have fundamentally transformed
human-AI interaction by enabling voice-based communication, yet they may
exhibit acoustic-based gender differentiation where identical questions lead to
different responses based on the speaker's gender. This paper propose a new
dataset that enables systematic analysis of this phenomenon, containing 9,208
speech samples across three categories: Gender-Independent,
Gender-Stereotypical, and Gender-Dependent. We further evaluated LLaMA-Omni
series and discovered a paradoxical pattern; while overall responses seems
identical regardless of gender, the pattern is far from unbiased responses.
Specifically, in Gender-Stereotypical questions, all models consistently
exhibited male-oriented responses; meanwhile, in Gender-Dependent questions
where gender differentiation would be contextually appropriate, models
exhibited responses independent to gender instead. We also confirm that this
pattern does not result from neutral options nor perceived gender of a voice.
When we allow neutral response, models tends to respond neutrally also in
Gender-Dependent questions. The paradoxical pattern yet retains when we applied
gender neutralization methods on speech. Through comparison between SpeechLMs
with corresponding backbone LLMs, we confirmed that these paradoxical patterns
primarily stem from Whisper speech encoders, which generates male-oriented
acoustic tokens. These findings reveal that current SpeechLMs may not
successfully remove gender biases though they prioritized general fairness
principles over contextual appropriateness, highlighting the need for more
sophisticated techniques to utilize gender information properly in speech
technology.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本论文提出了ROC框架，通过将多模态关系提取重算法为检索任务，克服了传统方法在结构约束和语义表达上的局限性，并在相关数据集上取得了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管最近的研究将传统的关系提取扩展到多模态场景，但大多数方法仍然采用以分类为基础的范式，使用融合的多模态特征将关系表示为离散标签。这种范式存在两个显著的局限性：一是忽略了结构约束，如实体类型和位置线索；二是缺乏对细粒度关系理解的语义表达能力。

Method: ROC将多模态关系提取重新表述为一个以关系语义为驱动的检索任务，通过多模态编码器整合实体类型和位置信息，使用大语言模型扩展关系标签为自然语言描述，并通过基于语义相似性的对比学习对齐实体-关系对。

Result: 实验结果表明，我们的方法在基准数据集MNRE和MORE上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 我们提出的ROC框架在基准数据集MNRE和MORE上实现了最先进的性能，并显示出更强的稳健性和可解释性。

Abstract: Relation extraction (RE) aims to identify semantic relations between entities
in unstructured text. Although recent work extends traditional RE to multimodal
scenarios, most approaches still adopt classification-based paradigms with
fused multimodal features, representing relations as discrete labels. This
paradigm has two significant limitations: (1) it overlooks structural
constraints like entity types and positional cues, and (2) it lacks semantic
expressiveness for fine-grained relation understanding. We propose
\underline{R}etrieval \underline{O}ver \underline{C}lassification (ROC), a
novel framework that reformulates multimodal RE as a retrieval task driven by
relation semantics. ROC integrates entity type and positional information
through a multimodal encoder, expands relation labels into natural language
descriptions using a large language model, and aligns entity-relation pairs via
semantic similarity-based contrastive learning. Experiments show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark datasets MNRE and
MORE and exhibits stronger robustness and interpretability.

Method: 通过合成训练数据集进行实验，并引入评估框架检测训练模型中的语法-领域相关性。

Result: 在OLMo-2模型中发现，语法-领域相关性降低了实体知识任务的性能，且在FlanV2数据集的部分模型中检测到这一现象。

Conclusion: 语法-领域之间的虚假相关性可能会影响LLM对任务指令的理解，从而降低性能。

Abstract: For an LLM to correctly respond to an instruction it must understand both the
semantics and the domain (i.e., subject area) of a given task-instruction pair.
However, syntax can also convey implicit information Recent work shows that
syntactic templates--frequent sequences of Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags--are
prevalent in training data and often appear in model outputs. In this work we
characterize syntactic templates, domain, and semantics in task-instruction
pairs. We identify cases of spurious correlations between syntax and domain,
where models learn to associate a domain with syntax during training; this can
sometimes override prompt semantics. Using a synthetic training dataset, we
find that the syntactic-domain correlation can lower performance (mean 0.51 +/-
0.06) on entity knowledge tasks in OLMo-2 models (1B-13B). We introduce an
evaluation framework to detect this phenomenon in trained models, and show that
it occurs on a subset of the FlanV2 dataset in open (OLMo-2-7B;
Llama-4-Maverick), and closed (GPT-4o) models. Finally, we present a case study
on the implications for safety finetuning, showing that unintended
syntactic-domain correlations can be used to bypass refusals in OLMo-2-7B
Instruct and GPT-4o. Our findings highlight two needs: (1) to explicitly test
for syntactic-domain correlations, and (2) to ensure syntactic diversity in
training data, specifically within domains, to prevent such spurious
correlations.

Motivation: 幽默的创造和感知是人类的一种基本特征，理解和生成幽默是现代大型语言模型（LLMs）评估常识知识和推理能力的一个重要任务。

Method: 通过对计算幽默领域的文献进行调查，特别关注幽默的生成和解释任务。

Result: 尽管理解幽默是一个基础的自然语言处理任务，但除了双关语之外，生成和解释幽默的相关研究仍然稀缺，且现有的先进模型在这方面仍然落后于人类能力。

Conclusion: 计算幽默处理作为自然语言处理的一个子学科至关重要，未来的研究应考虑幽默的主观性和伦理模糊性。

Abstract: The creation and perception of humour is a fundamental human trait,
positioning its computational understanding as one of the most challenging
tasks in natural language processing (NLP). As an abstract, creative, and
frequently context-dependent construct, humour requires extensive reasoning to
understand and create, making it a pertinent task for assessing the
common-sense knowledge and reasoning abilities of modern large language models
(LLMs). In this work, we survey the landscape of computational humour as it
pertains to the generative tasks of creation and explanation. We observe that,
despite the task of understanding humour bearing all the hallmarks of a
foundational NLP task, work on generating and explaining humour beyond puns
remains sparse, while state-of-the-art models continue to fall short of human
capabilities. We bookend our literature survey by motivating the importance of
computational humour processing as a subdiscipline of NLP and presenting an
extensive discussion of future directions for research in the area that takes
into account the subjective and ethically ambiguous nature of humour.

Motivation: 随着小型语言模型在特定领域的应用越来越广泛，了解其在下游任务中可能存在的个人信息泄漏问题变得尤为重要。

Method: 本研究提出了一种基于贪婪坐标梯度的GEP方法，专门用于个人可识别信息的提取。

Result: GEP方法在检测个人可识别信息泄露时比传统模板方法提高了多达60倍的泄露量，且在更复杂情况下表现依然良好。

Conclusion: GEP方法显著提高了SLM中个人可识别信息泄露的检测效率，显示出与传统方法相比的优势。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) become unprecedentedly appealing due to their
approximately equivalent performance compared to large language models (LLMs)
in certain fields with less energy and time consumption during training and
inference. However, the personally identifiable information (PII) leakage of
SLMs for downstream tasks has yet to be explored. In this study, we investigate
the PII leakage of the chatbot based on SLM. We first finetune a new chatbot,
i.e., ChatBioGPT based on the backbone of BioGPT using medical datasets Alpaca
and HealthCareMagic. It shows a matchable performance in BERTscore compared
with previous studies of ChatDoctor and ChatGPT. Based on this model, we prove
that the previous template-based PII attacking methods cannot effectively
extract the PII in the dataset for leakage detection under the SLM condition.
We then propose GEP, which is a greedy coordinate gradient-based (GCG) method
specifically designed for PII extraction. We conduct experimental studies of
GEP and the results show an increment of up to 60$\times$ more leakage compared
with the previous template-based methods. We further expand the capability of
GEP in the case of a more complicated and realistic situation by conducting
free-style insertion where the inserted PII in the dataset is in the form of
various syntactic expressions instead of fixed templates, and GEP is still able
to reveal a PII leakage rate of up to 4.53%.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong progress on
scientific reasoning, yet two major bottlenecks remain. First, explicit
retrieval fragments reasoning, imposing a hidden "tool tax" of extra tokens and
steps. Second, multi-agent pipelines often dilute strong solutions by averaging
across all candidates. We address these challenges with a unified framework
that combines implicit retrieval and structured collaboration. At its
foundation, a Monitor-based retrieval module operates at the token level,
integrating external knowledge with minimal disruption to reasoning. On top of
this substrate, Hierarchical Solution Refinement (HSR) iteratively designates
each candidate as an anchor to be repaired by its peers, while Quality-Aware
Iterative Reasoning (QAIR) adapts refinement to solution quality. On Humanity's
Last Exam (HLE) Bio/Chem Gold, our framework achieves 48.3\% accuracy -- the
highest reported to date, surpassing the strongest agent baseline by 13.4
points and leading frontier LLMs by up to 18.1 points, while simultaneously
reducing token usage by 53.5\% and agent steps by 43.7\%. Results on SuperGPQA
and TRQA confirm robustness across domains. Error analysis shows that reasoning
failures and knowledge gaps co-occur in over 85\% of cases, while diversity
analysis reveals a clear dichotomy: retrieval tasks benefit from solution
variety, whereas reasoning tasks favor consensus. Together, these findings
demonstrate how implicit augmentation and structured refinement overcome the
inefficiencies of explicit tool use and uniform aggregation. Code is available

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在法律文本分析中的可靠性受限于一般化预训练，未能深入法律知识

Method: 构建CLaw基准，包含中国法律全306部法规及254个案例推理实例的综合评估

Result: 现有大语言模型在法律条款的准确引用上表现不佳，影响法律推理的可靠性

Conclusion: 实现可靠的法律推理需要准确的知识检索与强大的推理能力的结合

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with analyzing legal
texts and citing relevant statutes, yet their reliability is often compromised
by general pre-training that ingests legal texts without specialized focus,
obscuring the true depth of their legal knowledge. This paper introduces CLaw,
a novel benchmark specifically engineered to meticulously evaluate LLMs on
Chinese legal knowledge and its application in reasoning. CLaw comprises two
key components: (1) a comprehensive, fine-grained corpus of all 306 Chinese
national statutes, segmented to the subparagraph level and incorporating
precise historical revision timesteps for rigorous recall evaluation (64,849
entries), and (2) a challenging set of 254 case-based reasoning instances
derived from China Supreme Court curated materials to assess the practical
application of legal knowledge. Our empirical evaluation reveals that most
contemporary LLMs significantly struggle to faithfully reproduce legal
provisions. As accurate retrieval and citation of legal provisions form the
basis of legal reasoning, this deficiency critically undermines the reliability
of their responses. We contend that achieving trustworthy legal reasoning in
LLMs requires a robust synergy of accurate knowledge retrieval--potentially
enhanced through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG)--and strong general reasoning capabilities. This work provides an
essential benchmark and critical insights for advancing domain-specific LLM
reasoning, particularly within the complex legal sphere.

Result: 在LongMemEval和LoCoMo实验中，SGMem consistently improves accuracy and outperforms strong baselines。

Conclusion: SGMem通过使用句子级图形来管理对话历史，实现了更有效的上下文处理，显著提升了长期对话问答的准确性。

Abstract: Long-term conversational agents require effective memory management to handle
dialogue histories that exceed the context window of large language models
(LLMs). Existing methods based on fact extraction or summarization reduce
redundancy but struggle to organize and retrieve relevant information across
different granularities of dialogue and generated memory. We introduce SGMem
(Sentence Graph Memory), which represents dialogue as sentence-level graphs
within chunked units, capturing associations across turn-, round-, and
session-level contexts. By combining retrieved raw dialogue with generated
memory such as summaries, facts and insights, SGMem supplies LLMs with coherent
and relevant context for response generation. Experiments on LongMemEval and
LoCoMo show that SGMem consistently improves accuracy and outperforms strong
baselines in long-term conversational question answering.

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enriches large language

multi-hop reasoning, but existing methods face a granularity dilemma:
fine-grained entity-level graphs incur high token costs and lose context, while
coarse document-level graphs fail to capture nuanced relations. We introduce
QCG-RAG, a query-centric graph RAG framework that enables query-granular
indexing and multi-hop chunk retrieval. Our query-centric approach leverages
Doc2Query and Doc2Query{-}{-} to construct query-centric graphs with
controllable granularity, improving graph quality and interpretability. A
tailored multi-hop retrieval mechanism then selects relevant chunks via the
generated queries. Experiments on LiHuaWorld and MultiHop-RAG show that QCG-RAG
consistently outperforms prior chunk-based and graph-based RAG methods in
question answering accuracy, establishing a new paradigm for multi-hop
reasoning.

Conclusion: 提出了一种测量同音词重复率的方法，并通过扩展提示来减少同音词重复问题及其引起的翻译偏差。

Abstract: Homonyms are words with identical spelling but distinct meanings, which pose
challenges for many generative models. When a homonym appears in a prompt,
diffusion models may generate multiple senses of the word simultaneously, which
is known as homonym duplication. This issue is further complicated by an
Anglocentric bias, which includes an additional translation step before the
text-to-image model pipeline. As a result, even words that are not homonymous
in the original language may become homonyms and lose their meaning after
translation into English. In this paper, we introduce a method for measuring
duplication rates and conduct evaluations of different diffusion models using
both automatic evaluation utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLM) and human
evaluation. Additionally, we investigate methods to mitigate the homonym
duplication problem through prompt expansion, demonstrating that this approach
also effectively reduces duplication related to Anglocentric bias. The code for
the automatic evaluation pipeline is publicly available.

TL;DR: 本文通过提出任务分类法和基于任务的功能多样性评估方法，解决了输出同质化的多样性及质量问题，展示了任务依赖对输出同质化评估与缓解的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的研究未能根据任务类别有效概念化输出多样性，导致对同质化问题的理解和处理不足。

Method: 提出了一种基于任务的采样技术，以增加功能多样性，同时保留所需的同质化。

Result: 定义了八个任务类别的任务分类法，并引入了基于任务的功能多样性评估，挑战了多样性与质量之间的权衡观念。

Conclusion: 通过针对任务的依赖性，我们展示了如何改善输出同质化的评估和缓解。

Abstract: A large language model can be less helpful if it exhibits output response
homogenization. But whether two responses are considered homogeneous, and
whether such homogenization is problematic, both depend on the task category.
For instance, in objective math tasks, we often expect no variation in the
final answer but anticipate variation in the problem-solving strategy. Whereas,
for creative writing tasks, we may expect variation in key narrative components
(e.g. plot, genre, setting, etc), beyond the vocabulary or embedding diversity
produced by temperature-sampling. Previous work addressing output
homogenization often fails to conceptualize diversity in a task-dependent way.
We address this gap in the literature directly by making the following
contributions. (1) We present a task taxonomy comprised of eight task
categories that each have distinct conceptualizations of output homogenization.
(2) We introduce task-anchored functional diversity to better evaluate output
homogenization. (3) We propose a task-anchored sampling technique that
increases functional diversity for task categories where homogenization is
undesired, while preserving homogenization where it is desired. (4) We
challenge the perceived existence of a diversity-quality trade-off by
increasing functional diversity while maintaining response quality. Overall, we
demonstrate how task dependence improves the evaluation and mitigation of
output homogenization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集无法有效支持AI生成文本的检测，尤其是在混合人- AI作家的情况下，缺乏字符级注释的标注数据。

Method: 利用现代专有和开源大型语言模型（LLMs）构建一个双语语料库，包含人- AI混合作者文本的字符级注释。

Result: LLMTrace是一个大型双语语料库，支持传统的全文本二元分类和新的AI生成区间检测任务。

Conclusion: LLMTrace为AI生成文本检测提供了一种重要的资源，支持更精细和实际的检测模型训练和评估。

Abstract: The widespread use of human-like text from Large Language Models (LLMs)
necessitates the development of robust detection systems. However, progress is
limited by a critical lack of suitable training data; existing datasets are
often generated with outdated models, are predominantly in English, and fail to
address the increasingly common scenario of mixed human-AI authorship.
Crucially, while some datasets address mixed authorship, none provide the
character-level annotations required for the precise localization of
AI-generated segments within a text. To address these gaps, we introduce
LLMTrace, a new large-scale, bilingual (English and Russian) corpus for
AI-generated text detection. Constructed using a diverse range of modern
proprietary and open-source LLMs, our dataset is designed to support two key
tasks: traditional full-text binary classification (human vs. AI) and the novel
task of AI-generated interval detection, facilitated by character-level
annotations. We believe LLMTrace will serve as a vital resource for training
and evaluating the next generation of more nuanced and practical AI detection
models. The project page is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现有研究中，输入扰动对链式推理（CoT）输出的影响尚未得到充分的理论解释，限制了对推理过程中的输入扰动传播的深入理解。

Method: 对输入扰动对链式推理输出波动的影响进行理论分析，并推导出上界。此外，通过实验验证理论分析的结果。

Result: 理论分析与实验结果一致，验证了输入扰动和推理输出波动之间的关系。

Conclusion: 输入扰动的影响在推理过程中无法通过无限长的推理过程消除，同时推理步骤的数量与输入扰动的上限正相关。

Abstract: Existing research indicates that the output of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is
significantly affected by input perturbations. Although many methods aim to
mitigate such impact by optimizing prompts, a theoretical explanation of how
these perturbations influence CoT outputs remains an open area of research.
This gap limits our in-depth understanding of how input perturbations propagate
during the reasoning process and hinders further improvements in prompt
optimization methods. Therefore, in this paper, we theoretically analyze the
effect of input perturbations on the fluctuation of CoT outputs. We first
derive an upper bound for input perturbations under the condition that the
output fluctuation is within an acceptable range, based on which we prove that:
(i) This upper bound is positively correlated with the number of reasoning
steps in the CoT; (ii) Even an infinitely long reasoning process cannot
eliminate the impact of input perturbations. We then apply these conclusions to
the Linear Self-Attention (LSA) model, which can be viewed as a simplified
version of the Transformer. For the LSA model, we prove that the upper bound
for input perturbation is negatively correlated with the norms of the input
embedding and hidden state vectors. To validate this theoretical analysis, we
conduct experiments on three mainstream datasets and four mainstream models.
The experimental results align with our theoretical analysis, empirically
demonstrating the correctness of our findings.

TL;DR: DisCoCLIP是一个结合CLIP与张量网络的新型多模态编码器，提升了语言结构对视觉-语言推理的影响，实现了高效且可解释的表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言模型在大规模图像-文本对齐中表现优秀，但往往忽视了语言的组合结构，导致在依赖词序和谓词-论元结构的任务上失败。

Method: 结合冻结的CLIP视觉变换器与新颖的张量网络文本编码器，并使用组合范畴语法解析器解析句子，从而生成分布式词张量。

Result: DisCoCLIP显著提高了动词语义和词序的灵敏度，将CLIP的SVO-Probes动词准确率从77.6%提升至82.4%，ARO归属和关系评分分别提升超过9%和4%，在新引入的SVO-Swap基准测试中达到了93.7%。

Conclusion: DisCoCLIP通过引入显式语言结构的张量网络，提高了视觉-语言任务中的组合推理能力，展现了可解释性和参数效率。

Abstract: Recent vision-language models excel at large-scale image-text alignment but
often neglect the compositional structure of language, leading to failures on
tasks that hinge on word order and predicate-argument structure. We introduce
DisCoCLIP, a multimodal encoder that combines a frozen CLIP vision transformer
with a novel tensor network text encoder that explicitly encodes syntactic
structure. Sentences are parsed with a Combinatory Categorial Grammar parser to
yield distributional word tensors whose contractions mirror the sentence's
grammatical derivation. To keep the model efficient, high-order tensors are
factorized with tensor decompositions, reducing parameter count from tens of
millions to under one million. Trained end-to-end with a self-supervised
contrastive loss, DisCoCLIP markedly improves sensitivity to verb semantics and
word order: it raises CLIP's SVO-Probes verb accuracy from 77.6% to 82.4%,
boosts ARO attribution and relation scores by over 9% and 4%, and achieves
93.7% on a newly introduced SVO-Swap benchmark. These results demonstrate that
embedding explicit linguistic structure via tensor networks yields
interpretable, parameter-efficient representations that substantially improve
compositional reasoning in vision-language tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够跨语言有效运作并保持文化基础的人工智能系统，尤其是在低资源环境中，是一项长期挑战。

Method: 通过利用大型开源大规模语言模型（参数>= 235B）生成基于语言特定维基百科内容的合成、文化上下文化的数据集。

Result: 生成的数据质量高，人类评估显示仍需改进，经过微调的模型在多个任务上表现良好，特别是在低和中等资源语言上的相对改进最为显著。

Conclusion: 有效的多语言人工智能需要多方面的数据策划和生成策略，结合上下文感知和文化基础的方法。

Abstract: Developing AI systems that operate effectively across languages while
remaining culturally grounded is a long-standing challenge, particularly in
low-resource settings. Synthetic data provides a promising avenue, yet its
effectiveness in multilingual and multicultural contexts remains underexplored.
We investigate the creation and impact of synthetic, culturally contextualized
datasets for Indian languages through a bottom-up generation strategy that
prompts large open-source LLMs (>= 235B parameters) to ground data generation
in language-specific Wikipedia content. This approach complements the dominant
top-down paradigm of translating synthetic datasets from high-resource
languages such as English. We introduce Updesh, a high-quality large-scale
synthetic instruction-following dataset comprising 9.5M data points across 13
Indian languages, encompassing diverse reasoning and generative tasks with an
emphasis on long-context, multi-turn capabilities, and alignment with Indian
cultural contexts. A comprehensive evaluation incorporating both automated
metrics and human annotation across 10k assessments indicates that generated
data is high quality; though, human evaluation highlights areas for further
improvement. Additionally, we perform downstream evaluations by fine-tuning
models on our dataset and assessing the performance across 15 diverse
multilingual datasets. Models trained on Updesh consistently achieve
significant gains on generative tasks and remain competitive on multiple-choice
style NLU tasks. Notably, relative improvements are most pronounced in low and
medium-resource languages, narrowing their gap with high-resource languages.
These findings provide empirical evidence that effective multilingual AI
requires multi-faceted data curation and generation strategies that incorporate
context-aware, culturally grounded methodologies.

Motivation: 探讨大语言模型中谄媚行为是否源于单一机制或多种独立过程。

Method: 通过对比均值方向、激活添加和子空间几何分析，研究谄媚行为的编码。

Result: 三种行为在潜在空间中沿着不同的线性方向编码，并且每种行为可以独立放大或抑制，其表示结构在不同模型家族和规模中是一致的。

Conclusion: 谄媚行为对应于不同的、可独立操控的表示形式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behaviors -- such as
excessive agreement with or flattery of the user -- but it is unclear whether
these behaviors arise from a single mechanism or multiple distinct processes.
We decompose sycophancy into sycophantic agreement and sycophantic praise,
contrasting both with genuine agreement. Using difference-in-means directions,
activation additions, and subspace geometry across multiple models and
datasets, we show that: (1) the three behaviors are encoded along distinct
linear directions in latent space; (2) each behavior can be independently
amplified or suppressed without affecting the others; and (3) their
representational structure is consistent across model families and scales.
These results suggest that sycophantic behaviors correspond to distinct,
independently steerable representations.

Motivation: 针对现有RLHF和RLVR方法在可解释性和适用范围上的限制，提出了一种新的方法，以提高响应质量的评估。

Method: 提出了一种结合人类反馈和规则验证的新方法，通过二元反馈原则进行奖励模型训练，并提供开放源码。

Result: RLBFF训练的奖励模型在RM-Bench和JudgeBench基准测试中表现出色，且用户可以在推理时自定义关注原则。

Conclusion: RLBFF能够结合人类偏好的灵活性和基于规则的验证的精确性，实现更高效的奖励模型训练，且在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM
post-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with
interpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that
usually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus
on correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary
Flexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven
preferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward
models to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness.
RLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g.
accuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language
feedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as
an entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary
principle). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform
Bradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on
RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24,
2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time
to customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry
models. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to
align Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the
performance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of
MT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost).

TL;DR: 本研究提出QAMO方法，利用质量感知多质心提升深度伪造语音检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单质心假设带来的简化问题，充分利用语音质量信息。

Method: 提出了一种新型的质量感知多质心单类学习方法。

Result: 在In-the-Wild数据集中，通过两个质心表示高低质量语音，QAMO达到了5.09%的等错误率，优于以往的方法。

Conclusion: QAMO通过引入多个质量感知质心，显著提高了深度伪造语音检测的准确性。

Abstract: Recent work shows that one-class learning can detect unseen deepfake attacks
by modeling a compact distribution of bona fide speech around a single
centroid. However, the single-centroid assumption can oversimplify the bona
fide speech representation and overlook useful cues, such as speech quality,
which reflects the naturalness of the speech. Speech quality can be easily
obtained using existing speech quality assessment models that estimate it
through Mean Opinion Score. In this paper, we propose QAMO: Quality-Aware
Multi-Centroid One-Class Learning for speech deepfake detection. QAMO extends
conventional one-class learning by introducing multiple quality-aware
centroids. In QAMO, each centroid is optimized to represent a distinct speech
quality subspaces, enabling better modeling of intra-class variability in bona
fide speech. In addition, QAMO supports a multi-centroid ensemble scoring
strategy, which improves decision thresholding and reduces the need for quality
labels during inference. With two centroids to represent high- and low-quality
speech, our proposed QAMO achieves an equal error rate of 5.09% in In-the-Wild
dataset, outperforming previous one-class and quality-aware systems.

Motivation: 探索并解决训练过程中原始输入与增强输入的梯度不一致问题，以改善模型的收敛性和优化效果。

Method: 提出了一种双路径数据增强（DPDA）训练框架，处理原始语音和增强版本的输入，以比较和对齐反向传播的梯度方向。

Result: 在使用RawBoost数据增强时，约25%的训练迭代显示了原始输入与增强输入之间的梯度冲突，通过梯度对齐解决了这些冲突。

Conclusion: 通过使用梯度对齐技术，DPDA框架减少了优化冲突，加快了收敛速度，并在In-the-Wild数据集上相较于基线实现了最高18.69%的误差率减少。

Abstract: In speech deepfake detection (SDD), data augmentation (DA) is commonly used
to improve model generalization across varied speech conditions and spoofing
attacks. However, during training, the backpropagated gradients from original
and augmented inputs may misalign, which can result in conflicting parameter
updates. These conflicts could hinder convergence and push the model toward
suboptimal solutions, thereby reducing the benefits of DA. To investigate and
address this issue, we design a dual-path data-augmented (DPDA) training
framework with gradient alignment for SDD. In our framework, each training
utterance is processed through two input paths: one using the original speech
and the other with its augmented version. This design allows us to compare and
align their backpropagated gradient directions to reduce optimization
conflicts. Our analysis shows that approximately 25% of training iterations
exhibit gradient conflicts between the original inputs and their augmented
counterparts when using RawBoost augmentation. By resolving these conflicts
with gradient alignment, our method accelerates convergence by reducing the
number of training epochs and achieves up to an 18.69% relative reduction in
Equal Error Rate on the In-the-Wild dataset compared to the baseline.

representations in a shared embedding space, serves as a cornerstone for
building a wide range of applications, from cross-modal retrieval to
cutting-edge multimodal large language models. However, we find that the
perpendicular component of the pushing force from negative samples in
contrastive learning is a double-edged sword: it contains rich supplementary
information from negative samples, yet its unconstrained nature causes
optimization trajectory drift and training instability. To address this, we
propose Support Vector Regularization (SVR), a method that introduces an
auxiliary support vector to control this perpendicular component, aiming to
harness its rich information while mitigating the associated trajectory drift.
The efficacy of SVR is critically governed by its semantic radius, for which we
explore two unsupervised modeling strategies: direct parameterization and an
adaptive radius predictor module enhanced with constraints to improve its
predicting accuracy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method
surpasses widely used baselines like InfoNCE and SigLIP loss across
classification, monolingual retrieval, and multilingual retrieval on standard
audio-text datasets. Both the theoretical analysis and the experimental results
on optimizing trajectory drift validate the correctness and effectiveness of
our SVR method.

Abstract: The ultimate goal of expressive speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) is to
accurately translate spoken content while preserving the speaker identity and
emotional style. However, progress in this field is largely hindered by three
key challenges: the scarcity of paired speech data that retains expressive
styles, the complexity of multi-stage processing pipelines, and the limited
transfer of translation capabilities from large language models (LLMs). In this
work, we address these challenges by introducing UniSS, a novel single-stage
framework for expressive S2ST. Our approach features carefully designed speech
semantic and style modeling, enabling seamless integration with existing
text-based LLM frameworks to develop a unified text-speech language model. To
transfer translation capabilities from text to speech, we propose a cross-modal
chain-of-thought prompting process that progressively aligns audio semantics
with text and ensures style preservation in the decoded results. Furthermore,
we construct and release a large-scale, high-quality expressive S2ST dataset,
UniST, comprising 44.8k hours of data. Experimental results show that UniSS
significantly outperforms previous methods in translation fidelity and speech
quality while preserving voice, emotion, and duration consistency. Our work
establishes a simpler and more effective paradigm for building the next
generation of expressive S2ST systems. Audio samples are available at

### [1] [LoRA-Edge: Tensor-Train-Assisted LoRA for Practical CNN Fine-Tuning on Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03765)
*Hyunseok Kwak,Kyeongwon Lee,Jae-Jin Lee,Woojoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoRA-Edge是一种用于边缘设备上CNN微调的参数高效方法，通过张量分解和选择性更新，在只训练1.49%参数的情况下能达到接近全微调的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决边缘设备上CNN微调内存、计算和能耗严格限制的问题，应对领域漂移挑战。

Method: 基于LoRA框架，使用张量链SVD分解预训练卷积层，选择性更新输出侧核心，并采用零初始化保持辅助路径初始不活跃。

Result: 在HAR数据集上精度比全微调仅差4.7%，参数更新量最多1.49%，收敛速度提升1.4-3.8倍。

Conclusion: LoRA-Edge实现了结构对齐、参数高效的在设备CNN适配，适用于边缘平台。

Abstract: On-device fine-tuning of CNNs is essential to withstand domain shift in edge
applications such as Human Activity Recognition (HAR), yet full fine-tuning is
infeasible under strict memory, compute, and energy budgets. We present
LoRA-Edge, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that builds on
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with tensor-train assistance. LoRA-Edge (i) applies
Tensor-Train Singular Value Decomposition (TT-SVD) to pre-trained convolutional
layers, (ii) selectively updates only the output-side core with
zero-initialization to keep the auxiliary path inactive at the start, and (iii)
fuses the update back into dense kernels, leaving inference cost unchanged.
This design preserves convolutional structure and reduces the number of
trainable parameters by up to two orders of magnitude compared to full
fine-tuning. Across diverse HAR datasets and CNN backbones, LoRA-Edge achieves
accuracy within 4.7% of full fine-tuning while updating at most 1.49% of
parameters, consistently outperforming prior parameter-efficient baselines
under similar budgets. On a Jetson Orin Nano, TT-SVD initialization and
selective-core training yield 1.4-3.8x faster convergence to target F1.
LoRA-Edge thus makes structure-aligned, parameter-efficient on-device CNN
adaptation practical for edge platforms.

### [2] [SILVI: Simple Interface for Labeling Video Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03819)
*Ozan Kanbertay,Richard Vogg,Elif Karakoc,Peter M. Kappeler,Claudia Fichtel,Alexander S. Ecker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一个名为SILVI的开源标记软件，用于在视频数据中注释动物和人类的行为及互动，填补了现有工具在行为标签化和个体定位方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算机视觉方法主要关注个体行为检测，而缺乏对互动的检测和注释。现有开源注释工具要么只支持行为标签化而不定位个体，要么只支持定位而不包含互动能力。

Method: 开发了SILVI，一个开源标记软件，整合了行为标签化和个体定位功能，允许研究人员在视频数据中直接注释行为和互动，生成结构化输出。

Result: SILVI能够生成适合训练和验证计算机视觉模型的结构化输出，促进了自动细粒度行为分析方法的发展。

Conclusion: SILVI桥接了行为生态学和计算机视觉，不仅适用于动物行为研究，还可用于注释人类互动，支持动态场景图的提取。

Abstract: Computer vision methods are increasingly used for the automated analysis of
large volumes of video data collected through camera traps, drones, or direct
observations of animals in the wild. While recent advances have focused
primarily on detecting individual actions, much less work has addressed the
detection and annotation of interactions -- a crucial aspect for understanding
social and individualized animal behavior. Existing open-source annotation
tools support either behavioral labeling without localization of individuals,
or localization without the capacity to capture interactions. To bridge this
gap, we present SILVI, an open-source labeling software that integrates both
functionalities. SILVI enables researchers to annotate behaviors and
interactions directly within video data, generating structured outputs suitable
for training and validating computer vision models. By linking behavioral
ecology with computer vision, SILVI facilitates the development of automated
approaches for fine-grained behavioral analyses. Although developed primarily
in the context of animal behavior, SILVI could be useful more broadly to
annotate human interactions in other videos that require extracting dynamic
scene graphs. The software, along with documentation and download instructions,
is available at: https://gitlab.gwdg.de/kanbertay/interaction-labelling-app.

### [3] [Noise Injection: Improving Out-of-Distribution Generalization for Limited Size Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03855)
*Duong Mai,Lawrence Hall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究分析了深度学习模型在COVID-19胸部X光检测中因依赖数据源特定伪影而导致的泛化能力不足问题，提出了通过注入基础噪声技术来提升模型对分布变化的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在影像识别中容易学习到训练数据中的特定伪影（捷径），而非真正的生物标志物，导致模型在面对不同设备、人群等分布外数据时泛化能力下降。特别是在COVID-19胸部X光检测中，这种问题尤为突出。

Method: 研究通过在训练过程中注入四种基础噪声（高斯噪声、斑点噪声、泊松噪声和椒盐噪声）来提高模型的鲁棒性，减少对数据源特定伪影的依赖。

Result: 实验结果表明，噪声注入技术能够显著缩小模型在分布内和分布外数据上的性能差距，从原来的0.10-0.20降低到0.01-0.06，这一结果在AUC、F1、准确率、召回率和特异性等多个关键指标上得到验证。

Conclusion: 基础噪声注入是一种简单有效的技术，能够显著提升深度学习模型在COVID-19胸部X光检测中的泛化能力，减少对分布变化的敏感性。

Abstract: Deep learned (DL) models for image recognition have been shown to fail to
generalize to data from different devices, populations, etc. COVID-19 detection
from Chest X-rays (CXRs), in particular, has been shown to fail to generalize
to out-of-distribution (OOD) data from new clinical sources not covered in the
training set. This occurs because models learn to exploit shortcuts -
source-specific artifacts that do not translate to new distributions - rather
than reasonable biomarkers to maximize performance on in-distribution (ID)
data. Rendering the models more robust to distribution shifts, our study
investigates the use of fundamental noise injection techniques (Gaussian,
Speckle, Poisson, and Salt and Pepper) during training. Our empirical results
demonstrate that this technique can significantly reduce the performance gap
between ID and OOD evaluation from 0.10-0.20 to 0.01-0.06, based on results
averaged over ten random seeds across key metrics such as AUC, F1, accuracy,
recall and specificity. Our source code is publicly available at

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Imitation learning-based robot control policies are enjoying renewed interest
in video-based robotics. However, it remains unclear whether this approach
applies to X-ray-guided procedures, such as spine instrumentation. This is
because interpretation of multi-view X-rays is complex. We examine
opportunities and challenges for imitation policy learning in bi-plane-guided
cannula insertion. We develop an in silico sandbox for scalable, automated
simulation of X-ray-guided spine procedures with a high degree of realism. We
curate a dataset of correct trajectories and corresponding bi-planar X-ray
sequences that emulate the stepwise alignment of providers. We then train
imitation learning policies for planning and open-loop control that iteratively
align a cannula solely based on visual information. This precisely controlled
setup offers insights into limitations and capabilities of this method. Our
policy succeeded on the first attempt in 68.5% of cases, maintaining safe
intra-pedicular trajectories across diverse vertebral levels. The policy
generalized to complex anatomy, including fractures, and remained robust to
varied initializations. Rollouts on real bi-planar X-rays further suggest that
the model can produce plausible trajectories, despite training exclusively in
simulation. While these preliminary results are promising, we also identify
limitations, especially in entry point precision. Full closed-look control will
require additional considerations around how to provide sufficiently frequent
feedback. With more robust priors and domain knowledge, such models may provide
a foundation for future efforts toward lightweight and CT-free robotic
intra-operative spinal navigation.

### [5] [Desert Waste Detection and Classification Using Data-Based and Model-Based Enhanced YOLOv12 DL Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03888)
*Abdulmumin Sa'ad,Sulaimon Oyeniyi Adebayo,Abdul Jabbar Siddiqui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于改进型YOLOv12的实时废弃物检测框架，结合自对抗训练和数据增强，在沙漠环境中实现高精度、低延迟的无人机部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球废弃物危机加剧，传统收集方式在偏远沙漠环境效率低下且危险。现有计算机视觉研究多关注城市可回收物，缺乏对有机/危险废弃物及沙漠地形的研究。

Method: 采用剪枝轻量化YOLOv12架构，集成自对抗训练(SAT)和专项数据增强策略，使用DroneTrashNet数据集进行训练。

Result: 在精确率、召回率和mAP指标上显著提升，同时保持低延迟和小模型体积，适合资源受限的无人机部署，在轻量级YOLO变体中实现精度与效率的最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 验证了数据增强与模型优化相结合的方法对沙漠环境实时废弃物检测的有效性，为恶劣环境下的自动化垃圾收集提供技术支撑。

Abstract: The global waste crisis is escalating, with solid waste generation expected
to increase by 70% by 2050. Traditional waste collection methods, particularly
in remote or harsh environments like deserts, are labor-intensive, inefficient,
and often hazardous. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning have
opened the door to automated waste detection systems, yet most research focuses
on urban environments and recyclable materials, overlooking organic and
hazardous waste and underexplored terrains such as deserts. In this work, we
propose an enhanced real-time object detection framework based on a pruned,
lightweight version of YOLOv12 integrated with Self-Adversarial Training (SAT)
and specialized data augmentation strategies. Using the DroneTrashNet dataset,
we demonstrate significant improvements in precision, recall, and mean average
precision (mAP), while achieving low latency and compact model size suitable
for deployment on resource-constrained aerial drones. Benchmarking our model
against state-of-the-art lightweight YOLO variants further highlights its
optimal balance of accuracy and efficiency. Our results validate the
effectiveness of combining data-centric and model-centric enhancements for
robust, real-time waste detection in desert environments.

### [6] [Improving Diagnostic Performance on Small and Imbalanced Datasets Using Class-Based Input Image Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03891)
*Hlali Azzeddine,Majid Ben Yakhlef,Soulaiman El Hazzat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文通过新的图像合成方法解决小样本不平衡数据集导致的错误预测问题，在医学影像分类任务中显著提升模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型不平衡数据集和低质量输入图像会导致深度学习模型产生高错误率，需要一种方法来增强训练样本的信息密度和多样性

Method: 提出基于类别的图像合成方法，将同一类别的多个图像融合成组合视觉复合图像，增加类内方差和信息密度

Result: 在OCTDL数据集上的实验表明，该方法将准确率提升至99.6%，F1分数0.995，AUC达到0.9996，显著降低了错误预测率

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升模型在小样本不平衡数据集上的表现，即使在数据质量较差的情况下也能产生高质量预测

Abstract: Small, imbalanced datasets and poor input image quality can lead to high
false predictions rates with deep learning models. This paper introduces
Class-Based Image Composition, an approach that allows us to reformulate
training inputs through a fusion of multiple images of the same class into
combined visual composites, named Composite Input Images (CoImg). That enhances
the intra-class variance and improves the valuable information density per
training sample and increases the ability of the model to distinguish between
subtle disease patterns. Our method was evaluated on the Optical Coherence
Tomography Dataset for Image-Based Deep Learning Methods (OCTDL) (Kulyabin et
al., 2024), which contains 2,064 high-resolution optical coherence tomography
(OCT) scans of the human retina, representing seven distinct diseases with a
significant class imbalance. We constructed a perfectly class-balanced version
of this dataset, named Co-OCTDL, where each scan is resented as a 3x1 layout
composite image. To assess the effectiveness of this new representation, we
conducted a comparative analysis between the original dataset and its variant
using a VGG16 model. A fair comparison was ensured by utilizing the identical
model architecture and hyperparameters for all experiments. The proposed
approach markedly improved diagnostic results.The enhanced Dataset achieved
near-perfect accuracy (99.6%) with F1-score (0.995) and AUC (0.9996), compared
to a baseline model trained on raw dataset. The false prediction rate was also
significantly lower, this demonstrates that the method can producehigh-quality
predictions even for weak datasets affected by class imbalance or small sample
size.

### [7] [I Detect What I Don't Know: Incremental Anomaly Learning with Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian for Oracle-Free Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03912)
*Nand Kumar Yadav,Rodrigue Rizk,William CW Chen,KC Santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种无监督的异常检测框架，通过逐步扩大正常样本集的方式进行医学图像异常检测，无需异常标签或专家监督，取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像异常检测面临标注异常稀缺、专家监督成本高的根本性挑战，需要开发无需标注的无监督方法。

Method: 基于小规模已验证正常图像种子集，交替进行轻量级适配器更新和基于不确定性的样本收录。使用冻结预训练视觉主干网络，添加微型卷积适配器实现快速领域适应，通过双概率门控机制确保安全扩展。

Result: 在多个医学图像数据集上取得显著改进：COVID-CXR（ROC-AUC从0.9489提升到0.9982）、肺炎CXR（从0.6834到0.8968）、脑部MRI（ROC-AUC从0.6041到0.7269）。

Conclusion: 该方法在标签稀缺的医学图像应用中表现出高效性和有效性，能够随着无标注数据的到来逐步完善正常性概念。

Abstract: Unknown anomaly detection in medical imaging remains a fundamental challenge
due to the scarcity of labeled anomalies and the high cost of expert
supervision. We introduce an unsupervised, oracle-free framework that
incrementally expands a trusted set of normal samples without any anomaly
labels. Starting from a small, verified seed of normal images, our method
alternates between lightweight adapter updates and uncertainty-gated sample
admission. A frozen pretrained vision backbone is augmented with tiny
convolutional adapters, ensuring rapid domain adaptation with negligible
computational overhead. Extracted embeddings are stored in a compact coreset
enabling efficient k-nearest neighbor anomaly (k-NN) scoring. Safety during
incremental expansion is enforced by dual probabilistic gates, a sample is
admitted into the normal memory only if its distance to the existing coreset
lies within a calibrated z-score threshold, and its SWAG-based epistemic
uncertainty remains below a seed-calibrated bound. This mechanism prevents
drift and false inclusions without relying on generative reconstruction or
replay buffers. Empirically, our system steadily refines the notion of
normality as unlabeled data arrive, producing substantial gains over baselines.
On COVID-CXR, ROC-AUC improves from 0.9489 to 0.9982 (F1: 0.8048 to 0.9746); on
Pneumonia CXR, ROC-AUC rises from 0.6834 to 0.8968; and on Brain MRI ND-5,
ROC-AUC increases from 0.6041 to 0.7269 and PR-AUC from 0.7539 to 0.8211. These
results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework
for real-world, label-scarce medical imaging applications.

### [8] [Adaptive Temporal Refinement: Continuous Depth Allocation and Distance Regression for Efficient Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03943)
*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了边界距离回归(BDR)和自适应时间精化(ATR)两个互补方法，通过距离回归代替分类实现更精确的边界定位，并根据边界难度自适应分配计算资源，在多个基准测试上显著提升了时序动作定位的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的时序动作定位方法对所有边界应用相同的计算量，忽视了不同边界难度的显著差异，导致计算资源分配不均和定位精度不足。

Method: 1. 边界距离回归(BDR)：使用有符号距离回归而非分类，实现信息理论最优的边界定位
2. 自适应时间精化(ATR)：通过连续深度选择自适应分配计算资源，支持端到端可微优化
3. 结合知识蒸馏降低训练成本

Result: 在THUMOS14数据集上，ATR在162G FLOPs下达到56.5% mAP@0.7，相比均匀处理的53.6%(198G FLOPs)提升了2.9%且减少18%计算量；BDR为现有方法带来1.8-3.1%的mAP@0.7提升，边界峰锐度提高43%；在短动作上提升达4.2%。

Conclusion: BDR和ATR方法有效解决了时序动作定位中的计算资源分配不均问题，实现了精度和效率的双重提升，且易于集成到现有架构中，在四个基准测试上均得到验证。

Abstract: Temporal action localization requires precise boundary detection; however,
current methods apply uniform computation despite significant variations in
difficulty across boundaries. We present two complementary contributions.
First, Boundary Distance Regression (BDR) provides information-theoretically
optimal localization through signed-distance regression rather than
classification, achieving 43\% sharper boundary peaks. BDR retrofits to
existing methods with approximately 50 lines of code, yielding consistent 1.8
to 3.1\% mAP@0.7 improvements across diverse architectures. Second, Adaptive
Temporal Refinement (ATR) allocates computation via continuous depth selection
$\tau \in [0,1]$, enabling end-to-end differentiable optimization without
reinforcement learning. On THUMOS14, ATR achieves 56.5\% mAP@0.7 at 162G FLOPs,
compared to 53.6\% at 198G for uniform processing, providing a 2.9\%
improvement with 18\% less compute. Gains scale with boundary heterogeneity,
showing 4.2\% improvement on short actions. Training cost is mitigated via
knowledge distillation, with lightweight students retaining 99\% performance at
baseline cost. Results are validated across four benchmarks with rigorous
statistical testing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一优化几何和外观的高斯-网格联合优化框架，通过可微分渲染实现网格和顶点颜色的同时优化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将几何精度和真实感渲染分开优化，这阻碍了下游编辑任务，需要一种统一处理几何和外观优化的方法

Method: 使用高斯引导的网格可微分渲染，同时优化网格几何（顶点位置和面片）和顶点颜色，利用输入图像的光度一致性和法向量/深度图的几何正则化

Result: 获得了高质量的三维重建结果

Conclusion: 该方法可实现无缝的高斯-网格联合优化，获得的高质量重建模型可进一步用于重照明和形状变形等下游编辑任务

Abstract: Reconstructing real-world objects from multi-view images is essential for
applications in 3D editing, AR/VR, and digital content creation. Existing
methods typically prioritize either geometric accuracy (Multi-View Stereo) or
photorealistic rendering (Novel View Synthesis), often decoupling geometry and
appearance optimization, which hinders downstream editing tasks. This paper
advocates an unified treatment on geometry and appearance optimization for
seamless Gaussian-mesh joint optimization. More specifically, we propose a
novel framework that simultaneously optimizes mesh geometry (vertex positions
and faces) and vertex colors via Gaussian-guided mesh differentiable rendering,
leveraging photometric consistency from input images and geometric
regularization from normal and depth maps. The obtained high-quality 3D
reconstruction can be further exploit in down-stream editing tasks, such as
relighting and shape deformation. The code will be publicly available upon
acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过线性分数变换参数α解耦主透镜和微透镜阵列的光场相机内参标定方法，包含基于最小二乘的解析解和非线性优化，并验证了在物理和模拟数据上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光场相机进行3D重建时，精确的内参标定是一个关键但具有挑战性的前提条件。

Method: 使用线性分数变换参数α解耦主透镜和微透镜阵列，包括基于最小二乘的解析解和非线性优化，并介绍了从原始图像中检测特征的方法。

Result: 在物理和模拟数据上的实验验证了所提方法的性能，基于该模型的光场图像模拟速度更快，有助于数据驱动的深度学习方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为光场相机的内参标定提供了一种有效的解决方案，相关代码可从作者网站获取。

Abstract: Accurate calibration of internal parameters is a crucial yet challenging
prerequisite for 3D reconstruction using light field cameras. In this paper, we
propose a linear fractional transformation(LFT) parameter $\alpha$ to decoupled
the main lens and micro lens array (MLA). The proposed method includes an
analytical solution based on least squares, followed by nonlinear refinement.
The method for detecting features from the raw images is also introduced.
Experimental results on both physical and simulated data have verified the
performance of proposed method. Based on proposed model, the simulation of raw
light field images becomes faster, which is crucial for data-driven deep
learning methods. The corresponding code can be obtained from the author's

### [11] [Room Envelopes: A Synthetic Dataset for Indoor Layout Reconstruction from Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03970)
*Sam Bahrami,Dylan Campbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了一个名为Room Envelopes的合成数据集，旨在解决场景重建中隐蔽表面预测的问题，通过提供RGB图像及对应的可见表面和结构布局点图，支持单目几何估计器预测场景的完整结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前场景重建方法只能恢复可见表面，导致重建不完整，忽略了隐蔽的表面。虽然生成模型在部分观测下重建整个对象方面取得了进展，但场景的结构元素（如墙壁、地板和天花板）的研究较少。这些元素通常平面、重复且简单，因此可能适合成本较低的方法。

Method: 论文提出了一个合成数据集Room Envelopes，包含RGB图像及两个点图：一个捕捉可见表面，另一个捕捉移除装饰和设施后的结构布局。这为前馈单目几何估计器提供了直接监督，使其能预测可见表面和结构布局表面。

Result: 通过该数据集，模型可以理解场景的范围、对象的形状和位置，从而提升对隐蔽表面的预测能力。

Conclusion: Room Envelopes数据集为场景结构元素的预测提供了有效工具，支持低成本方法在隐蔽表面重建中的应用，促进了场景完整理解的研究进展。

Abstract: Modern scene reconstruction methods are able to accurately recover 3D
surfaces that are visible in one or more images. However, this leads to
incomplete reconstructions, missing all occluded surfaces. While much progress
has been made on reconstructing entire objects given partial observations using
generative models, the structural elements of a scene, like the walls, floors
and ceilings, have received less attention. We argue that these scene elements
should be relatively easy to predict, since they are typically planar,
repetitive and simple, and so less costly approaches may be suitable. In this
work, we present a synthetic dataset -- Room Envelopes -- that facilitates
progress on this task by providing a set of RGB images and two associated
pointmaps for each image: one capturing the visible surface and one capturing
the first surface once fittings and fixtures are removed, that is, the
structural layout. As we show, this enables direct supervision for feed-forward
monocular geometry estimators that predict both the first visible surface and
the first layout surface. This confers an understanding of the scene's extent,
as well as the shape and location of its objects.

### [12] [Simple 3D Pose Features Support Human and Machine Social Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03988)
*Wenshuo Qin,Leyla Isik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇研究发现人类利用3D姿态信息进行社交互动判断，而大多数AI视觉模型缺乏这种能力。通过提取3D关节位置，研究证明了使用简单3D社会姿态特征就能匹配完整关节集的预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够快速从视觉输入中提取社交互动信息，但当前AI视觉系统在这方面存在挑战。研究者假设人类依赖3D视觉空间姿态信息进行社交判断，而大多数AI模型缺乏这种能力。

Method: 将最先进的姿态和深度估计算法结合，提取视频中人物的3D关节位置，开发了一套紧凑的3D社会姿态特征来描述面部位置和方向，并与现有AI模型进行比较。

Result: 3D关节位置表现优于大多数AI视觉模型，简单3D社会姿态特征与完整关节集预测能力相当，与现成AI模型结合时能显著提升其性能。

Conclusion: 人类社交场景理解依赖于3D姿态的显式表示，可以通过简单的结构化视觉空间基元支持，这为改进AI社交互动识别提供了新方向。

Abstract: Humans can quickly and effortlessly extract a variety of information about
others' social interactions from visual input, ranging from visuospatial cues
like whether two people are facing each other to higher-level information. Yet,
the computations supporting these abilities remain poorly understood, and
social interaction recognition continues to challenge even the most advanced AI
vision systems. Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose
information to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI
vision models. To test this, we combined state-of-the-art pose and depth
estimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions of people in short video
clips depicting everyday human actions and compared their ability to predict
human social interaction judgments with current AI vision models. Strikingly,
3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that
key social information is available in explicit body position but not in the
learned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise
embeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions. To uncover the
critical pose features humans use to make social judgments, we derived a
compact set of 3D social pose features describing only the 3D position and
direction of faces in the videos. We found that these minimal descriptors
matched the predictive strength of the full set of 3D joints and significantly
improved the performance of off-the-shelf AI vision models when combined with
their embeddings. Moreover, the degree to which 3D social pose features were
represented in each off-the-shelf AI vision model predicted the model's ability
to match human social judgments. Together, our findings provide strong evidence
that human social scene understanding relies on explicit representations of 3D
pose and can be supported by simple, structured visuospatial primitives.

*Yuwen Tao,Kanglei Zhou,Xin Tan,Yuan Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Camera Aware Referring Field (CaRF)框架，通过引入相机几何编码和视图监督机制，解决基于3D高斯场的语言引导分割中的多视角一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖2D伪监督和视图特异性特征学习，在多视图一致性上表现不足。CaRF旨在直接在3D高斯空间操作，实现跨视角一致的查询定位。

Method: CaRF包含两个核心组件：1) Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE) - 将相机几何融入高斯-文本交互；2) In Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) - 在训练期间对齐校准视图的高斯逻辑值。

Result: 在Ref LERF、LERF OVS和3D OVS三个基准测试上，mIoU分别比SOTA方法提升16.8%、4.3%和2.0%。

Conclusion: CaRF显著提升了3D场景理解的可靠性和视角一致性，对具身AI、AR/VR交互和自主感知具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS) aims to interpret
free-form language expressions and localize the corresponding 3D regions in
Gaussian fields. While recent advances have introduced cross-modal alignment
between language and 3D geometry, existing pipelines still struggle with
cross-view consistency due to their reliance on 2D rendered pseudo supervision
and view specific feature learning. In this work, we present Camera Aware
Referring Field (CaRF), a fully differentiable framework that operates directly
in the 3D Gaussian space and achieves multi view consistency. Specifically,
CaRF introduces Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE), which incorporates
camera geometry into Gaussian text interactions to explicitly model view
dependent variations and enhance geometric reasoning. Building on this, In
Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) is proposed to align per Gaussian
logits across calibrated views during training, effectively mitigating single
view overfitting and exposing inter view discrepancies for optimization.
Extensive experiments on three representative benchmarks demonstrate that CaRF
achieves average improvements of 16.8%, 4.3%, and 2.0% in mIoU over state of
the art methods on the Ref LERF, LERF OVS, and 3D OVS datasets, respectively.
Moreover, this work promotes more reliable and view consistent 3D scene
understanding, with potential benefits for embodied AI, AR/VR interaction, and
autonomous perception.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have achieved impressive
perceptual quality, yet generated content often violates fundamental principles
of physical plausibility - manifesting as implausible object dynamics,
incoherent interactions, and unrealistic motion patterns. Such failures hinder
the deployment of video generation models in embodied AI, robotics, and
simulation-intensive domains. To bridge this gap, we propose PhysCorr, a
unified framework for modeling, evaluating, and optimizing physical consistency
in video generation. Specifically, we introduce PhysicsRM, the first
dual-dimensional reward model that quantifies both intra-object stability and
inter-object interactions. On this foundation, we develop PhyDPO, a novel
direct preference optimization pipeline that leverages contrastive feedback and
physics-aware reweighting to guide generation toward physically coherent
outputs. Our approach is model-agnostic and scalable, enabling seamless
integration into a wide range of video diffusion and transformer-based
backbones. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
PhysCorr achieves significant improvements in physical realism while preserving
visual fidelity and semantic alignment. This work takes a critical step toward
physically grounded and trustworthy video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准微调成本高且可能损害泛化性能，需要参数高效的领域泛化方法。

Method: 使用GNN路由器（GCN、GAT、SAGE）在图像块间图上进行动态路由，结合Kronecker适配器实现参数高效微调。

Result: 在领域泛化基准测试中达到最优或竞争性性能，同时保持高参数效率。

Conclusion: 基于图的上下文路由为轻量级鲁棒领域泛化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) seeks robust Vision Transformer (ViT) performance
on unseen domains. Efficiently adapting pretrained ViTs for DG is challenging;
standard fine-tuning is costly and can impair generalization. We propose
GNN-MoE, enhancing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for DG with a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework using efficient Kronecker adapters. Instead
of token-based routing, a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) router (GCN, GAT,
SAGE) operates on inter-patch graphs to dynamically assign patches to
specialized experts. This context-aware GNN routing leverages inter-patch
relationships for better adaptation to domain shifts. GNN-MoE achieves
state-of-the-art or competitive DG benchmark performance with high parameter
efficiency, highlighting the utility of graph-based contextual routing for
robust, lightweight DG.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了MedDChest，一种专门针对胸部医学影像优化的基础Vision Transformer模型。通过在大规模多模态胸部影像数据集上预训练，并结合新颖的内容感知数据增强技术，显著提升了胸部分析任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉模型在医学影像应用中通常使用在自然图像上预训练的骨干网络，但由于领域差距导致性能受限。医疗影像与自然图像存在根本的领域差异，需要专门针对医学领域优化的模型。

Method: 1）从零开始在120万张多模态胸部影像数据集上预训练ViT模型；2）提出引导随机调整裁剪（Guided Random Resized Crops）的数据增强技术，偏向采样解剖相关区域；3）在多样化下游诊断任务上进行微调验证。

Conclusion: MedDChest为胸部诊断任务提供了更强大的特征提取器，确立了领域内预训练的重要性。模型权重将公开以促进未来研究和应用。

Abstract: The performance of vision models in medical imaging is often hindered by the
prevailing paradigm of fine-tuning backbones pre-trained on out-of-domain
natural images. To address this fundamental domain gap, we propose MedDChest, a
new foundational Vision Transformer (ViT) model optimized specifically for
thoracic imaging. We pre-trained MedDChest from scratch on a massive, curated,
multimodal dataset of over 1.2 million images, encompassing different
modalities including Chest X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) compiled from 10
public sources. A core technical contribution of our work is Guided Random
Resized Crops, a novel content-aware data augmentation strategy that biases
sampling towards anatomically relevant regions, overcoming the inefficiency of
standard cropping techniques on medical scans. We validate our model's
effectiveness by fine-tuning it on a diverse set of downstream diagnostic
tasks. Comprehensive experiments empirically demonstrate that MedDChest
significantly outperforms strong, publicly available ImageNet-pretrained
models. By establishing the superiority of large-scale, in-domain pre-training
combined with domain-specific data augmentation, MedDChest provides a powerful
and robust feature extractor that serves as a significantly better starting
point for a wide array of thoracic diagnostic tasks. The model weights will be
made publicly available to foster future research and applications.

TL;DR: Faithful Contouring是一种稀疏体素化表示方法，支持2048+分辨率，无需将网格转换为场函数或提取等值面，实现了接近无损的保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于等值面的体素化表示方法严重依赖水密化或渲染优化，这会不可避免地损害几何保真度。

Method: 提出Faithful Contouring稀疏体素化表示，设计双模式自编码器，支持高分辨率表示且无需场函数转换。

Result: 在直接表示方面达到10^{-5}级别的距离误差；在网格重建方面，Chamfer距离减少93%，F-score提高35%。

Conclusion: Faithful Contouring在3D表示和重建任务中在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法，是3D学习任务的优越表示。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient voxelized representations of 3D meshes are the
foundation of 3D reconstruction and generation. However, existing
representations based on iso-surface heavily rely on water-tightening or
rendering optimization, which inevitably compromise geometric fidelity. We
propose Faithful Contouring, a sparse voxelized representation that supports
2048+ resolutions for arbitrary meshes, requiring neither converting meshes to
field functions nor extracting the isosurface during remeshing. It achieves
near-lossless fidelity by preserving sharpness and internal structures, even
for challenging cases with complex geometry and topology. The proposed method
also shows flexibility for texturing, manipulation, and editing. Beyond
representation, we design a dual-mode autoencoder for Faithful Contouring,
enabling scalable and detail-preserving shape reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that Faithful Contouring surpasses existing methods in
accuracy and efficiency for both representation and reconstruction. For direct
representation, it achieves distance errors at the $10^{-5}$ level; for mesh
reconstruction, it yields a 93\% reduction in Chamfer Distance and a 35\%
improvement in F-score over strong baselines, confirming superior fidelity as a
representation for 3D learning tasks.

*Arfina Rahman,Mahesh Banavar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于低帧率指尖视频PPG信号的生物特征认证框架，通过CWT时频变换和混合深度学习模型CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM，在46名受试者上达到98%的认证准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPG信号具有非侵入采集、活体检测和低成本特性，但易受运动伪影、光照变化和个体生理差异影响，需要开发鲁棒的特征提取和分类方法。

Method: 使用CFIHSR数据集(14Hz采样率)，预处理包括基线漂移去除、PCA运动伪影抑制、带通滤波、傅里叶重采样和幅度归一化。通过CWT将PPG信号转换为时频图，并设计CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM混合模型结合空间和时间特征。

Result: 在46名受试者上实现98%的认证准确率，模型对噪声和个体差异具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该系统具有高效性、可扩展性和活体检测能力，适合移动和嵌入式生物安全应用。

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, which measure changes in blood volume in
the skin using light, have recently gained attention in biometric
authentication because of their non-invasive acquisition, inherent liveness
detection, and suitability for low-cost wearable devices. However, PPG signal
quality is challenged by motion artifacts, illumination changes, and
inter-subject physiological variability, making robust feature extraction and
classification crucial. This study proposes a lightweight and cost-effective
biometric authentication framework based on PPG signals extracted from
low-frame-rate fingertip videos. The CFIHSR dataset, comprising PPG recordings
from 46 subjects at a sampling rate of 14 Hz, is employed for evaluation. The
raw PPG signals undergo a standard preprocessing pipeline involving baseline
drift removal, motion artifact suppression using Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), bandpass filtering, Fourier-based resampling, and amplitude
normalization. To generate robust representations, each one-dimensional PPG
segment is converted into a two-dimensional time-frequency scalogram via the
Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), effectively capturing transient
cardiovascular dynamics. We developed a hybrid deep learning model, termed
CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM, by combining spatial features from the Convolutional Vision
Transformer (CVT) and ConvMixer branches with temporal features from a Long
Short-Term Memory network (LSTM). The experimental results on 46 subjects
demonstrate an authentication accuracy of 98%, validating the robustness of the
model to noise and variability between subjects. Due to its efficiency,
scalability, and inherent liveness detection capability, the proposed system is
well-suited for real-world mobile and embedded biometric security applications.

TL;DR: Bratrix框架通过多模态语言锚定视觉-大脑对齐，解决了神经信号解码中的语义提取难题，显著提升了脑信号检索、重建和描述性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接将神经活动与视觉嵌入对齐，但纯视觉表示难以捕捉潜在语义维度，限制了可解释性和鲁棒性。需要解决主体变异性和视觉特征纠缠问题。

Method: 提出Bratrix端到端框架：1）将视觉刺激解耦为分层视觉和语言语义组件 2）投影到共享潜在空间形成对齐嵌入 3）引入不确定性感知模块处理噪声神经信号 4）采用可学习语言锚定语义矩阵增强跨模态关联 5）两阶段训练策略（单模态预训练+多模态微调）

Result: 在EEG、MEG和fMRI基准测试中，Bratrix在检索、重建和描述任务上均超越现有方法，特别是在200-way EEG检索任务中提升14.3%。

Conclusion: Bratrix通过语言锚定的多模态对齐有效提升了脑神经信号语义解码的精度和鲁棒性，为视觉语义神经解码提供了新范式。

Abstract: Unveiling visual semantics from neural signals such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI
remains a fundamental challenge due to subject variability and the entangled
nature of visual features. Existing approaches primarily align neural activity
directly with visual embeddings, but visual-only representations often fail to
capture latent semantic dimensions, limiting interpretability and deep
robustness. To address these limitations, we propose Bratrix, the first
end-to-end framework to achieve multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain
alignment. Bratrix decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical visual and
linguistic semantic components, and projects both visual and brain
representations into a shared latent space, enabling the formation of aligned
visual-language and brain-language embeddings. To emulate human-like perceptual
reliability and handle noisy neural signals, Bratrix incorporates a novel
uncertainty perception module that applies uncertainty-aware weighting during
alignment. By leveraging learnable language-anchored semantic matrices to
enhance cross-modal correlations and employing a two-stage training strategy of
single-modality pretraining followed by multimodal fine-tuning, Bratrix-M
improves alignment precision. Extensive experiments on EEG, MEG, and fMRI
benchmarks demonstrate that Bratrix improves retrieval, reconstruction, and
captioning performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, specifically
surpassing 14.3% in 200-way EEG retrieval task. Code and model are available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究比较了CycleGAN和Noise2Score两种非配对自监督CT图像去噪方法，发现CycleGAN在标准U-Net架构下（λ_cycle=30, λ_iden=2）收敛后能显著提升信噪比（PSNR从34.66dB提高到38.913dB），而Noise2Score在极度噪声情况下也表现稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对CT图像去噪中配对标定数据难以获取的问题，探索无需配对标定数据的自监督去噪方法，比较两种强效且训练数据效率高的范式。

Method: 采用CycleGAN残差翻译器和Noise2Score得分匹配去噪器两种方法，在统一评估协议下进行配置扫描，选择最优的U-Net骨干网络在CycleGAN中训练至收敛。

Result: 优化的CycleGAN将PSNR从34.66dB提升至38.913dB，SSIM从0.9234提升至0.971；Noise2Score在绝对PSNR/SSIM上稍逊但在高噪声输入下表现优异。

Conclusion: CycleGAN提供了最强的最终图像质量，Noise2Score则是一种无需配对标定的稳健替代方案，两者在不同场景下各有优势。

Abstract: We study CT image denoising in the unpaired and self-supervised regimes by
evaluating two strong, training-data-efficient paradigms: a CycleGAN-based
residual translator and a Noise2Score (N2S) score-matching denoiser. Under a
common evaluation protocol, a configuration sweep identifies a simple standard
U-Net backbone within CycleGAN (lambda_cycle = 30, lambda_iden = 2, ngf = ndf =
64) as the most reliable setting; we then train it to convergence with a longer
schedule. The selected CycleGAN improves the noisy input from 34.66 dB / 0.9234
SSIM to 38.913 dB / 0.971 SSIM and attains an estimated score of 1.9441 and an
unseen-set (Kaggle leaderboard) score of 1.9343. Noise2Score, while slightly
behind in absolute PSNR / SSIM, achieves large gains over very noisy inputs,
highlighting its utility when clean pairs are unavailable. Overall, CycleGAN
offers the strongest final image quality, whereas Noise2Score provides a robust
pair-free alternative with competitive performance. Source code is available at

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is critical for accurate diagnostics and treatment
planning, but remains challenging due to complex anatomical structures and
limited annotated training data. CNN-based segmentation methods excel at local
feature extraction, but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies.
Transformers, on the other hand, capture global context more effectively, but
are inherently data-hungry and computationally expensive. In this work, we
introduce UKAST, a U-Net like architecture that integrates rational-function
based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into Swin Transformer encoders. By
leveraging rational base functions and Group Rational KANs (GR-KANs) from the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT), our architecture addresses the
inefficiencies of vanilla spline-based KANs, yielding a more expressive and
data-efficient framework with reduced FLOPs and only a very small increase in
parameter count compared to SwinUNETR. UKAST achieves state-of-the-art
performance on four diverse 2D and 3D medical image segmentation benchmarks,
consistently surpassing both CNN- and Transformer-based baselines. Notably, it
attains superior accuracy in data-scarce settings, alleviating the data-hungry
limitations of standard Vision Transformers. These results show the potential
of KAN-enhanced Transformers to advance data-efficient medical image
segmentation. Code is available at: https://github.com/nsapkota417/UKAST

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I方法对对象定位控制不足，无法充分利用位置信息理解空间布局，需要改进精确对象定位能力。

Method: 使用Position-Engaged Injection直接注入空间信息，Position-Guided Learning基于感知监督优化定位，联合控制生成空间位置。

Result: 实验表明SpatialLock在多个数据集上IOU得分超过0.9，实现了最先进的精准对象定位效果。

Conclusion: SpatialLock通过感知信号和接地信息联合控制，显著提升生成图像中对象空间定位精度和视觉质量。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) synthesis has made significant advancements in recent
years, driving applications such as generating datasets automatically. However,
precise control over object localization in generated images remains a
challenge. Existing methods fail to fully utilize positional information,
leading to an inadequate understanding of object spatial layouts. To address
this issue, we propose SpatialLock, a novel framework that leverages perception
signals and grounding information to jointly control the generation of spatial
locations. SpatialLock incorporates two components: Position-Engaged Injection
(PoI) and Position-Guided Learning (PoG). PoI directly integrates spatial
information through an attention layer, encouraging the model to learn the
grounding information effectively. PoG employs perception-based supervision to
further refine object localization. Together, these components enable the model
to generate objects with precise spatial arrangements and improve the visual
quality of the generated images. Experiments show that SpatialLock sets a new
state-of-the-art for precise object positioning, achieving IOU scores above 0.9
across multiple datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了Tortoise and Hare Guidance (THG)方法，无需训练即可加速扩散采样，同时保持高保真度生成，通过多速率ODE系统将计算量减少高达30%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型采样速度慢，现有加速方法往往牺牲生成质量。研究旨在找到既能加速采样又能保持高质量生成的训练免费方案。

Method: 将分类器自由引导(CFG) ODE重构为多速率ODE系统，噪声估计在细粒度时间步上计算（tortoise方程），附加引导项在粗粒度网格上计算（hare方程），并引入误差感知时间步采样器和引导规模调度器。

Result: THG将函数评估次数减少30%，在ImageReward指标上损失极小（≤0.032），在相同计算预算下优于现有最先进的CFG加速方法。

Conclusion: 多速率公式为扩散求解器提供了新思路，有望实现无需模型重训练的高质量实时图像合成。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Tortoise and Hare Guidance (THG), a training-free
strategy that accelerates diffusion sampling while maintaining high-fidelity
generation. We demonstrate that the noise estimate and the additional guidance
term exhibit markedly different sensitivity to numerical error by reformulating
the classifier-free guidance (CFG) ODE as a multirate system of ODEs. Our
error-bound analysis shows that the additional guidance branch is more robust
to approximation, revealing substantial redundancy that conventional solvers
fail to exploit. Building on this insight, THG significantly reduces the
computation of the additional guidance: the noise estimate is integrated with
the tortoise equation on the original, fine-grained timestep grid, while the
additional guidance is integrated with the hare equation only on a coarse grid.
We also introduce (i) an error-bound-aware timestep sampler that adaptively
selects step sizes and (ii) a guidance-scale scheduler that stabilizes large
extrapolation spans. THG reduces the number of function evaluations (NFE) by up
to 30% with virtually no loss in generation fidelity ($\Delta$ImageReward
$\leq$ 0.032) and outperforms state-of-the-art CFG-based training-free
accelerators under identical computation budgets. Our findings highlight the
potential of multirate formulations for diffusion solvers, paving the way for
real-time high-quality image synthesis without any model retraining. The source

Conclusion: M3S框架在素描生成中实现了有效的风格控制，通过创新的特征融合和引导机制提升了合成质量，为精确风格控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have facilitated progress in sketch
generation. However, existing specialized methods primarily focus on generic
synthesis and lack mechanisms for precise control over sketch styles. In this
work, we propose a training-free framework based on diffusion models that
enables explicit style guidance via textual prompts and referenced style
sketches. Unlike previous style transfer methods that overwrite key and value
matrices in self-attention, we incorporate the reference features as auxiliary
information with linear smoothing and leverage a style-content guidance
mechanism. This design effectively reduces content leakage from reference
sketches and enhances synthesis quality, especially in cases with low
structural similarity between reference and target sketches. Furthermore, we
extend our framework to support controllable multi-style generation by
integrating features from multiple reference sketches, coordinated via a joint
AdaIN module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
high-quality sketch generation with accurate style alignment and improved
flexibility in style control. The official implementation of M3S is available

Motivation: 海洋环境的复杂性导致相机运动和视觉质量下降，给多目标跟踪带来挑战。需要一种能够应对平台运动和目标固有运动分离的鲁棒跟踪方法。

Method: 采用双分支并行架构：1）目标检测和ReID分支，包含可逆柱状检测网络RCDN和轻量Transformer外观提取器Li-TAE；2）动态相机运动估计分支，通过投影变换分离平台运动和目标运动，在卡尔曼滤波中补偿平台运动。

Result: 在新加坡海事数据集上的广泛评估表明，DMSORT达到最先进性能，在保持高身份一致性的同时，在现有的基于ReID的MOT框架中运行速度最快，对抖动和遮挡具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DMSORT通过创新的双分支架构和运动补偿技术，有效解决了海上多目标跟踪的挑战，在复杂海洋环境下实现了高效且鲁棒的跟踪性能。

Abstract: Accurate perception of the marine environment through robust multi-object
tracking (MOT) is essential for ensuring safe vessel navigation and effective
maritime surveillance. However, the complicated maritime environment often
causes camera motion and subsequent visual degradation, posing significant
challenges to MOT. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient
Dual-branch Maritime SORT (DMSORT) method for maritime MOT. The core of the
framework is a parallel tracker with affine compensation, which incorporates an
object detection and re-identification (ReID) branch, along with a dedicated
branch for dynamic camera motion estimation. Specifically, a Reversible
Columnar Detection Network (RCDN) is integrated into the detection module to
leverage multi-level visual features for robust object detection. Furthermore,
a lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE) is designed to
capture global contextual information and generate robust appearance features.
Another branch decouples platform-induced and target-intrinsic motion by
constructing a projective transformation, applying platform-motion compensation
within the Kalman filter, and thereby stabilizing true object trajectories.
Finally, a clustering-optimized feature fusion module effectively combines
motion and appearance cues to ensure identity consistency under noise,
occlusion, and drift. Extensive evaluations on the Singapore Maritime Dataset
demonstrate that DMSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, DMSORT
attains the fastest runtime among existing ReID-based MOT frameworks while
maintaining high identity consistency and robustness to jitter and occlusion.

Abstract: Computer-use agents can operate computers and automate laborious tasks, but
despite recent rapid progress, they still lag behind human users, especially
when tasks require domain-specific procedural knowledge about particular
applications, platforms, and multi-step workflows. Humans can bridge this gap
by watching video tutorials: we search, skim, and selectively imitate short
segments that match our current subgoal. In this paper, we study how to enable
computer-use agents to learn from online videos at inference time effectively.
We propose a framework that retrieves and filters tutorial videos, converts
them into structured demonstration trajectories, and dynamically selects
trajectories as in-context guidance during execution. Particularly, using a
VLM, we infer UI actions, segment videos into short subsequences of actions,
and assign each subsequence a textual objective. At inference time, a two-stage
selection mechanism dynamically chooses a single trajectory to add in context
at each step, focusing the agent on the most helpful local guidance for its
next decision. Experiments on two widely used benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms strong base agents and variants that use
only textual tutorials or transcripts. Analyses highlight the importance of
trajectory segmentation and selection, action filtering, and visual
information, suggesting that abundant online videos can be systematically
distilled into actionable guidance that improves computer-use agents at
inference time. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 这是关于一种解决文档理解中图像旋转校正问题的研究，通过构建OCR旋转基准ORB并设计轻量级旋转分类管道，显著提升OCR性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在文档理解中，扫描或拍摄文档的方向校正是一个关键预处理步骤，对OCR等下游任务性能至关重要。由于用户错误（如相机基础方向不正确）导致的误对齐问题普遍存在。

Method: 1）引入OCR-Rotation-Bench（ORB）基准，包括英文OCR数据集旋转变换的ORB-En和涵盖11种印度语言的新多语言集ORB-Indic；2）基于Phi-3.5-Vision模型视觉编码器构建快速、鲁棒且轻量的旋转分类管道，采用动态图像裁剪，针对4类旋转任务进行独立微调。

Result: 1）该方法在两个数据集上分别达到96%和92%的旋转识别准确率；2）在模拟真实世界设置中，显著提升闭源模型（最高14%）和开源权重模型（最高4倍）的OCR性能。

Conclusion: 研究证明了旋转校正模块在提升OCR性能中的关键作用，提出的轻量级方法具有高效性和实用性，为文档理解预处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in document understanding, determining the
correct orientation of scanned or photographed documents remains a critical
pre-processing step in the real world settings. Accurate rotation correction is
essential for enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) where misalignment commonly arises due to user
errors, particularly incorrect base orientations of the camera during capture.
In this study, we first introduce OCR-Rotation-Bench (ORB), a new benchmark for
evaluating OCR robustness to image rotations, comprising (i) ORB-En, built from
rotation-transformed structured and free-form English OCR datasets, and (ii)
ORB-Indic, a novel multilingual set spanning 11 Indic mid to low-resource
languages. We also present a fast, robust and lightweight rotation
classification pipeline built on the vision encoder of Phi-3.5-Vision model
with dynamic image cropping, fine-tuned specifically for 4-class rotation task
in a standalone fashion. Our method achieves near-perfect 96% and 92% accuracy
on identifying the rotations respectively on both the datasets. Beyond
classification, we demonstrate the critical role of our module in boosting OCR
performance: closed-source (up to 14%) and open-weights models (up to 4x) in
the simulated real-world setting.

*Fatemehzahra Darzi,Rodrigo Escobar Diaz Guerrero,Thomas Bocklitz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，在数字病理学中，通过CycleGAN颜色变换处理后的H&E染色图像与非线性多模态图像配准效果最佳，显著降低了配准误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数字病理学中，准确配准不同模态的图像对于生物标志物分析和组织重建等应用至关重要。本研究旨在探索不同颜色变换技术对H&E染色图像与多模态图像配准性能的影响。

Method: 使用20对组织样本，采用多种预处理方法（CycleGAN、Macenko、Reinhard、Vahadane颜色变换、反转、对比度调整、强度归一化和去噪），通过VALIS配准方法进行刚性和非刚性配准，并利用相对目标配准误差（rTRE）评估性能。

Result: 在所有测试场景中，CycleGAN颜色变换方法取得了最低的配准误差，其他方法表现较差。

Conclusion: 在配准前应用颜色变换（特别是CycleGAN）能有效改善不同模态图像间的对齐效果，为数字病理学提供更可靠的分析基础。

Abstract: Image registration refers to the process of spatially aligning two or more
images by mapping them into a common coordinate system, so that corresponding
anatomical or tissue structures are matched across images. In digital
pathology, registration enables direct comparison and integration of
information from different stains or imaging modalities, sup-porting
applications such as biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction. Accurate
registration of images from different modalities is an essential step in
digital pathology. In this study, we investigated how various color
transformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset
of 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing
steps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard,
Vahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and
denoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method,
which first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration
in two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance
was evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported
the median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values
(AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based
evaluation using ten manually selected key points. Registration was done
separately for two scenarios, using either the original or inverted multimodal
images. In both scenarios, CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest
registration errors, while the other methods showed higher errors. These
findings show that applying color transformation before registration improves
alignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable
analysis in digital pathology.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在医学图像分类中使用协方差描述符的有效性，特别是结合预训练的通用视觉编码器（GVEs）和SPDNet网络。结果显示GVE特征衍生的协方差描述符优于手工特征，且SPDNet与DINOv2组合性能最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协方差描述符在通用计算机视觉任务中表现强劲，但在医学影像领域尚未充分探索。本文旨在评估其在传统和基于学习的医学图像分类中的效果。

Method: 提出从预训练的通用视觉编码器（DINOv2和MedSAM）提取特征构建协方差描述符，并与手工描述符对比。使用SPDNet网络处理对称正定矩阵，在MedMNSIT基准的11个数据集上进行评估。

Result: GVE特征衍生的协方差描述符始终优于手工特征。SPDNet与DINOv2特征结合时，性能超过现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，将协方差描述符与强大的预训练视觉编码器结合，在医学图像分析中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Covariance descriptors capture second-order statistics of image features.
They have shown strong performance in general computer vision tasks, but remain
underexplored in medical imaging. We investigate their effectiveness for both
conventional and learning-based medical image classification, with a particular
focus on SPDNet, a classification network specifically designed for symmetric
positive definite (SPD) matrices. We propose constructing covariance
descriptors from features extracted by pre-trained general vision encoders
(GVEs) and comparing them with handcrafted descriptors. Two GVEs - DINOv2 and
MedSAM - are evaluated across eleven binary and multi-class datasets from the
MedMNSIT benchmark. Our results show that covariance descriptors derived from
GVE features consistently outperform those derived from handcrafted features.
Moreover, SPDNet yields superior performance to state-of-the-art methods when
combined with DINOv2 features. Our findings highlight the potential of
combining covariance descriptors with powerful pretrained vision encoders for
medical image analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于均值和方差的风格迁移方法在图像处理中有效，但由于图像和运动数据存在根本差异，这些方法在运动风格迁移中不足以充分捕捉复杂的动态模式和时空一致性特性。

Method: 提出AStF方法，包含Style Disentanglement Module（SDM）和High-Order Multi-Statistics Attention（HOS-Attn），并结合Motion Consistency Regularization（MCR）判别器进行训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，AStF通过更全面建模动态风格中的时空统计模式，在运动风格迁移方面表现出优于现有先进方法的性能。

Conclusion: 引入高阶统计量（偏度和峰度）能够更有效地捕捉运动风格特征，AStF方法在运动风格迁移任务中展现出显著优势。

Abstract: Human motion style transfer allows characters to appear less rigidity and
more realism with specific style. Traditional arbitrary image style transfer
typically process mean and variance which is proved effective. Meanwhile,
similar methods have been adapted for motion style transfer. However, due to
the fundamental differences between images and motion, relying on mean and
variance is insufficient to fully capture the complex dynamic patterns and
spatiotemporal coherence properties of motion data. Building upon this, our key
insight is to bring two more coefficient, skewness and kurtosis, into the
analysis of motion style. Specifically, we propose a novel Adaptive Statistics
Fusor (AStF) which consists of Style Disentanglement Module (SDM) and
High-Order Multi-Statistics Attention (HOS-Attn). We trained our AStF in
conjunction with a Motion Consistency Regularization (MCR) discriminator.
Experimental results show that, by providing a more comprehensive model of the
spatiotemporal statistical patterns inherent in dynamic styles, our proposed
AStF shows proficiency superiority in motion style transfers over
state-of-the-arts. Our code and model are available at

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了一个基础但被忽视的方法：将针对人类设计的预训练基础模型（如Sapiens）用于医学影像中的解剖标志点检测。提出MedSapiens模型，通过多数据集预训练，在多个数据集上达到新的最优性能。

Motivation: 传统标志点检测依赖领域特定模型，但大规模预训练视觉模型的出现提供了新机会。研究发现针对人类姿态估计优化的基础模型能为解剖标志点检测提供强先验，但这一潜力未被充分挖掘。

Method: 将Sapiens（人类姿态估计基础模型）通过多数据集预训练适应医学影像，得到MedSapiens模型。在有限数据设置下评估其对新下游任务的适应性。

Result: MedSapiens相比通用模型提升5.26%，相比专用模型提升21.81%的平均成功检测率。在少样本设置下比当前最优方法提升2.69%。

Conclusion: 人类中心基础模型为解剖标志点检测提供了强先验，MedSapiens证明了这种方法的有效性，在多项基准测试中达到新最优性能。

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a novel architecture; instead, it revisits a
fundamental yet overlooked baseline: adapting human-centric foundation models
for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging. While landmark detection
has traditionally relied on domain-specific models, the emergence of
large-scale pre-trained vision models presents new opportunities. In this
study, we investigate the adaptation of Sapiens, a human-centric foundation
model designed for pose estimation, to medical imaging through multi-dataset
pretraining, establishing a new state of the art across multiple datasets. Our
proposed model, MedSapiens, demonstrates that human-centric foundation models,
inherently optimized for spatial pose localization, provide strong priors for
anatomical landmark detection, yet this potential has remained largely
untapped. We benchmark MedSapiens against existing state-of-the-art models,
achieving up to 5.26% improvement over generalist models and up to 21.81%
improvement over specialist models in the average success detection rate (SDR).
To further assess MedSapiens adaptability to novel downstream tasks with few
annotations, we evaluate its performance in limited-data settings, achieving
2.69% improvement over the few-shot state of the art in SDR. Code and model
weights are available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/MedSapiens .

TL;DR: Proto-LeakNet 是一个基于信号泄漏感知的可解释溯源框架，通过潜空间建模和开放集评估实现合成图像源归属和深度伪造验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着合成图像和深度伪造生成模型日益复杂，源归属和真实性验证成为计算机视觉系统的关键挑战。扩散模型在输出中无意留下统计痕迹（信号泄漏），这为溯源提供了机会。

Method: 在扩散模型潜空间操作，通过部分前向扩散重模拟暴露生成器特定线索；使用时序注意力编码器聚合多步潜特征；采用特征加权原型头构建嵌入空间实现透明溯源；结合闭集分类和基于密度的开放集评估。

Result: 仅使用闭集数据训练，Macro AUC达到98.13%；学习的潜空间几何结构在后处理下保持鲁棒性；在已知和未知生成器之间实现强可分离性，超越现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 在潜空间建模信号泄漏偏差可实现可靠且可解释的AI图像和深度伪造取证，Proto-LeakNet框架为解决源归属问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: The growing sophistication of synthetic image and deepfake generation models
has turned source attribution and authenticity verification into a critical
challenge for modern computer vision systems. Recent studies suggest that
diffusion pipelines unintentionally imprint persistent statistical traces,
known as signal leaks, within their outputs, particularly in latent
representations. Building on this observation, we propose Proto-LeakNet, a
signal-leak-aware and interpretable attribution framework that integrates
closed-set classification with a density-based open-set evaluation on the
learned embeddings, enabling analysis of unseen generators without retraining.
Operating in the latent domain of diffusion models, our method re-simulates
partial forward diffusion to expose residual generator-specific cues. A
temporal attention encoder aggregates multi-step latent features, while a
feature-weighted prototype head structures the embedding space and enables
transparent attribution. Trained solely on closed data and achieving a Macro
AUC of 98.13%, Proto-LeakNet learns a latent geometry that remains robust under
post-processing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods, and achieves strong
separability between known and unseen generators. These results demonstrate
that modeling signal-leak bias in latent space enables reliable and
interpretable AI-image and deepfake forensics. The code for the whole work will
be available upon submission.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于DINOv2的门控表示学习框架（DinoGRL），通过结合步态特征和外观线索来解决视频可见光-红外人员重识别问题，显著提升了跨模态检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注模态不变的视觉特征，但忽视了步态特征的重要价值。步态特征不仅具有模态不变性，还包含丰富的时序动态信息，对跨模态视频匹配至关重要。

Method: 提出DinoGRL框架，包含语义感知轮廓和步态学习（SASGL）模型以及渐进式双向多粒度增强（PBMGE）模块，利用DINOv2的视觉先验学习互补的步态特征，并通过多粒度特征交互增强表示能力。

Result: 在HITSZ-VCM和BUPT数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法显著优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的DinoGRL框架能有效学习鲁棒的序列级表示，通过结合步态和外观特征的互补性，在跨模态人员重识别任务中取得了优越性能。

Abstract: Video-based Visible-Infrared person re-identification (VVI-ReID) aims to
retrieve the same pedestrian across visible and infrared modalities from video
sequences. Existing methods tend to exploit modality-invariant visual features
but largely overlook gait features, which are not only modality-invariant but
also rich in temporal dynamics, thus limiting their ability to model the
spatiotemporal consistency essential for cross-modal video matching. To address
these challenges, we propose a DINOv2-Driven Gait Representation Learning
(DinoGRL) framework that leverages the rich visual priors of DINOv2 to learn
gait features complementary to appearance cues, facilitating robust
sequence-level representations for cross-modal retrieval. Specifically, we
introduce a Semantic-Aware Silhouette and Gait Learning (SASGL) model, which
generates and enhances silhouette representations with general-purpose semantic
priors from DINOv2 and jointly optimizes them with the ReID objective to
achieve semantically enriched and task-adaptive gait feature learning.
Furthermore, we develop a Progressive Bidirectional Multi-Granularity
Enhancement (PBMGE) module, which progressively refines feature representations
by enabling bidirectional interactions between gait and appearance streams
across multiple spatial granularities, fully leveraging their complementarity
to enhance global representations with rich local details and produce highly
discriminative features. Extensive experiments on HITSZ-VCM and BUPT datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our approach, significantly outperforming
existing state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D高斯溅射加速方法在训练过程中未能有效调控高斯数量，导致冗余计算和时间开销。该方法旨在通过更智能的高斯管理来提升训练效率。

Method: 创新性地设计了基于多视图一致性的高斯密度化和剪枝策略，摒弃传统的预算机制，全面考虑每个高斯的重要性。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法，在Mip-NeRF 360数据集上实现3.32倍训练加速，在Deep Blending数据集上实现15.45倍加速，且保持可比的渲染质量。

Conclusion: FastGS展现出强大的通用性，在各种任务中都能实现2-7倍的训练加速，证明了该方法的高效性和普适性。

Abstract: The dominant 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) acceleration methods fail to
properly regulate the number of Gaussians during training, causing redundant
computational time overhead. In this paper, we propose FastGS, a novel, simple,
and general acceleration framework that fully considers the importance of each
Gaussian based on multi-view consistency, efficiently solving the trade-off
between training time and rendering quality. We innovatively design a
densification and pruning strategy based on multi-view consistency, dispensing
with the budgeting mechanism. Extensive experiments on Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks &
Temples, and Deep Blending datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in training speed, achieving a
3.32$\times$ training acceleration and comparable rendering quality compared
with DashGaussian on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset and a 15.45$\times$ acceleration
compared with vanilla 3DGS on the Deep Blending dataset. We demonstrate that
FastGS exhibits strong generality, delivering 2-7$\times$ training acceleration
across various tasks, including dynamic scene reconstruction, surface
reconstruction, sparse-view reconstruction, large-scale reconstruction, and
simultaneous localization and mapping. The project page is available at

Motivation: 除草剂田间试验需要准确识别植物物种和评估除草剂引起的损伤，但通用视觉基础模型在农业领域的细粒度区分任务上性能有限，因此需要开发领域特定的解决方案。

Method: 采用自监督学习方法，在大型精选农业数据集上训练领域特定的视觉基础模型，学习针对除草剂试验图像的丰富且可迁移的表征。

Result: 领域特定模型在物种识别（F1从0.91提升至0.94）和损伤分类（从0.26提升至0.33）上显著优于通用模型；在未见条件下提升更大，且能有效减少80%的标注样本需求。

Conclusion: 领域特定的基础模型具有强大的泛化能力，可以显著减少人工标注工作，为除草剂试验分析提供可扩展的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Herbicide field trials require accurate identification of plant species and
assessment of herbicide-induced damage across diverse environments. While
general-purpose vision foundation models have shown promising results in
complex visual domains, their performance can be limited in agriculture, where
fine-grained distinctions between species and damage types are critical.
  In this work, we adapt a general-purpose vision foundation model to herbicide
trial characterization. Trained using a self-supervised learning approach on a
large, curated agricultural dataset, the model learns rich and transferable
representations optimized for herbicide trials images.
  Our domain-specific model significantly outperforms the best general-purpose
foundation model in both species identification (F1 score improvement from 0.91
to 0.94) and damage classification (from 0.26 to 0.33). Under unseen conditions
(new locations and other time), it achieves even greater gains (species
identification from 0.56 to 0.66; damage classification from 0.17 to 0.27). In
domain-shift scenarios, such as drone imagery, it maintains strong performance
(species classification from 0.49 to 0.60).
  Additionally, we show that domain-specific pretraining enhances segmentation
accuracy, particularly in low-annotation regimes. An annotation-efficiency
analysis reveals that, under unseen conditions, the domain-specific model
achieves 5.4% higher F1 score than the general-purpose model, while using 80%
fewer labeled samples.
  These results demonstrate the generalization capabilities of domain-specific
foundation models and their potential to significantly reduce manual annotation
efforts, offering a scalable and automated solution for herbicide trial
analysis.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The recent and ongoing expansion of marine infrastructure, including offshore
wind farms, oil and gas platforms, artificial islands, and aquaculture
facilities, highlights the need for effective monitoring systems. The
development of robust models for offshore infrastructure detection relies on
comprehensive, balanced datasets, but falls short when samples are scarce,
particularly for underrepresented object classes, shapes, and sizes. By
training deep learning-based YOLOv10 object detection models with a combination
of synthetic and real Sentinel-1 satellite imagery acquired in the fourth
quarter of 2023 from four regions (Caspian Sea, South China Sea, Gulf of
Guinea, and Coast of Brazil), this study investigates the use of synthetic
training data to enhance model performance. We evaluated this approach by
applying the model to detect offshore platforms in three unseen regions (Gulf
of Mexico, North Sea, Persian Gulf) and thereby assess geographic
transferability. This region-holdout evaluation demonstrated that the model
generalises beyond the training areas. In total, 3,529 offshore platforms were
detected, including 411 in the North Sea, 1,519 in the Gulf of Mexico, and
1,593 in the Persian Gulf. The model achieved an F1 score of 0.85, which
improved to 0.90 upon incorporating synthetic data. We analysed how synthetic
data enhances the representation of unbalanced classes and overall model
performance, taking a first step toward globally transferable detection of
offshore infrastructure. This study underscores the importance of balanced
datasets and highlights synthetic data generation as an effective strategy to
address common challenges in remote sensing, demonstrating the potential of
deep learning for scalable, global offshore infrastructure monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频扩散模型依赖预训练文本编码器进行语义对齐，但处理简洁提示时难以保持视频质量，且无法在线重述提示以更好地匹配用户意图，限制了模型的可扩展性和可用性。

Method: 开发了Rephrasing Adapter模块，使扩散模型能在LLM预测下一令牌时利用文本隐藏状态作为视频生成条件，从而隐式地将基础提示重述为更全面的表示。

Result: 实验表明RISE-T2V适用于不同视频扩散模型架构，显著提升了T2V模型生成符合用户意图的高质量视频的能力。

Conclusion: RISE-T2V是一个通用框架，通过集成提示重述和语义特征提取，增强了T2V任务中模型对用户意图的理解和视频生成质量。

Abstract: Most text-to-video(T2V) diffusion models depend on pre-trained text encoders
for semantic alignment, yet they often fail to maintain video quality when
provided with concise prompts rather than well-designed ones. The primary issue
lies in their limited textual semantics understanding. Moreover, these text
encoders cannot rephrase prompts online to better align with user intentions,
which limits both the scalability and usability of the models, To address these
challenges, we introduce RISE-T2V, which uniquely integrates the processes of
prompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction into a single and seamless
step instead of two separate steps. RISE-T2V is universal and can be applied to
various pre-trained LLMs and video diffusion models(VDMs), significantly
enhancing their capabilities for T2V tasks. We propose an innovative module
called the Rephrasing Adapter, enabling diffusion models to utilize text hidden
states during the next token prediction of the LLM as a condition for video
generation. By employing a Rephrasing Adapter, the video generation model can
implicitly rephrase basic prompts into more comprehensive representations that
better match the user's intent. Furthermore, we leverage the powerful
capabilities of LLMs to enable video generation models to accomplish a broader
range of T2V tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE-T2V is a
versatile framework applicable to different video diffusion model
architectures, significantly enhancing the ability of T2V models to generate
high-quality videos that align with user intent. Visual results are available

Abstract: The accurate delineation of tumours in radiological images like Computed
Tomography is a very specialised and time-consuming task, and currently a
bottleneck preventing quantitative analyses to be performed routinely in the
clinical setting. For this reason, developing methods for the automated
segmentation of tumours in medical imaging is of the utmost importance and has
driven significant efforts in recent years. However, challenges regarding the
impracticality of 3D scans, given the large amount of voxels to be analysed,
usually requires the downsampling of such images or using patches thereof when
applying traditional convolutional neural networks. To overcome this problem,
in this paper we propose a new methodology that uses, divided into two stages,
voxel sparsification and submanifold sparse convolutional networks. This method
allows segmentations to be performed with high-resolution inputs and a native
3D model architecture, obtaining state-of-the-art accuracies while
significantly reducing the computational resources needed in terms of GPU
memory and time. We studied the deployment of this methodology in the context
of Computed Tomography images of renal cancer patients from the KiTS23
challenge, and our method achieved results competitive with the challenge
winners, with Dice similarity coefficients of 95.8% for kidneys + masses, 85.7%
for tumours + cysts, and 80.3% for tumours alone. Crucially, our method also
offers significant computational improvements, achieving up to a 60% reduction
in inference time and up to a 75\% reduction in VRAM usage compared to an
equivalent dense architecture, across both CPU and various GPU cards tested.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of nine convolutional neural
network architectures for binary classification of horses and motorcycles in
the VOC 2008 dataset. We address the significant class imbalance problem by
implementing minority-class augmentation techniques. Our experiments compare
modern architectures including ResNet-50, ConvNeXt-Tiny, DenseNet-121, and
Vision Transformer across multiple performance metrics. Results demonstrate
substantial performance variations, with ConvNeXt-Tiny achieving the highest
Average Precision (AP) of 95.53% for horse detection and 89.12% for motorcycle
detection. We observe that data augmentation significantly improves minority
class detection, particularly benefiting deeper architectures. This study
provides insights into architecture selection for imbalanced binary
classification tasks and quantifies the impact of data augmentation strategies
in mitigating class imbalance issues in object detection.

*Sanjay Kumar,Tim Brophy,Eoin Martino Grua,Ganesh Sistu,Valentina Donzella,Ciaran Eising*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究探讨传感器遮挡对基于BEV融合的3D物体检测的影响，发现相机在中等遮挡下性能下降41.3%，而激光雷达仅在严重遮挡时性能下降47.3%，融合模型更依赖激光雷达数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然BEV融合架构通过多模态集成展示了强大的性能，但环境条件（如雾、霾或物理障碍）引起的传感器遮挡对3D检测精度的影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用BEVFusion架构在nuScenes数据集上评估相机和激光雷达遮挡的影响，检测性能使用mAP和NDS指标衡量。

Result: 仅相机检测时中等遮挡导致mAP下降41.3%；激光雷达仅在严重遮挡时mAP下降47.3%；融合设置中遮挡相机导致mAP下降4.1%，遮挡激光雷达导致mAP下降26.8%。

Conclusion: 结果表明模型更依赖激光雷达进行3D物体检测，未来需要研究遮挡感知评估方法和改进的传感器融合技术以应对部分传感器故障或环境退化。

Abstract: Accurate 3D object detection is essential for automated vehicles to navigate
safely in complex real-world environments. Bird's Eye View (BEV)
representations, which project multi-sensor data into a top-down spatial
format, have emerged as a powerful approach for robust perception. Although
BEV-based fusion architectures have demonstrated strong performance through
multimodal integration, the effects of sensor occlusions, caused by
environmental conditions such as fog, haze, or physical obstructions, on 3D
detection accuracy remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate the
impact of occlusions on both camera and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)
outputs using the BEVFusion architecture, evaluated on the nuScenes dataset.
Detection performance is measured using mean Average Precision (mAP) and the
nuScenes Detection Score (NDS). Our results show that moderate camera
occlusions lead to a 41.3% drop in mAP (from 35.6% to 20.9%) when detection is
based only on the camera. On the other hand, LiDAR sharply drops in performance
only under heavy occlusion, with mAP falling by 47.3% (from 64.7% to 34.1%),
with a severe impact on long-range detection. In fused settings, the effect
depends on which sensor is occluded: occluding the camera leads to a minor 4.1%
drop (from 68.5% to 65.7%), while occluding LiDAR results in a larger 26.8%
drop (to 50.1%), revealing the model's stronger reliance on LiDAR for the task
of 3D object detection. Our results highlight the need for future research into
occlusion-aware evaluation methods and improved sensor fusion techniques that
can maintain detection accuracy in the presence of partial sensor failure or
degradation due to adverse environmental conditions.

Abstract: Background In analytical chemistry, spatial information about materials is
commonly captured through imaging techniques, such as traditional color cameras
or with advanced hyperspectral cameras and microscopes. However, efficiently
extracting and analyzing this spatial information for exploratory and
predictive purposes remains a challenge, especially when using traditional
chemometric methods. Recent advances in deep learning and artificial
intelligence have significantly enhanced image processing capabilities,
enabling the extraction of multiscale deep features that are otherwise
challenging to capture with conventional image processing techniques. Despite
the wide availability of open-source deep learning models, adoption in
analytical chemistry remains limited because of the absence of structured,
step-by-step guidance for implementing these models.
  Results This tutorial aims to bridge this gap by providing a step-by-step
guide for applying deep learning approaches to extract spatial information from
imaging data and integrating it with other data sources, such as spectral
information. Importantly, the focus of this work is not on training deep
learning models for image processing but on using existing open source models
to extract deep features from imaging data.
  Significance The tutorial provides MATLAB code tutorial demonstrations,
showcasing the processing of imaging data from various imaging modalities
commonly encountered in analytical chemistry. Readers must run the tutorial
steps on their own datasets using the codes presented in this tutorial.

approach substantially improves over single-task baselines in both answer
accuracy and visual localization, highlighting the effectiveness of grounded
multi-task learning for medical VQA applications.

Abstract: Depth estimation is one of the key technologies for realizing 3D perception
in unmanned systems. Monocular depth estimation has been widely researched
because of its low?cost advantage, but the existing methods face the challenges
of poor depth estimation performance and blurred object boundaries on embedded
systems. In this paper, we propose a novel monocular depth estimation model,
BoRe-Depth, which contains only 8.7M parameters. It can accurately estimate
depth maps on embedded systems and significantly improves boundary quality.
Firstly, we design an Enhanced Feature Adaptive Fusion Module (EFAF) which
adaptively fuses depth features to enhance boundary detail representation.
Secondly, we integrate semantic knowledge into the encoder to improve the
object recognition and boundary perception capabilities. Finally, BoRe-Depth is
deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, and runs efficiently at 50.7 FPS. We
demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms previous
lightweight models on multiple challenging datasets, and we provide detailed
ablation studies for the proposed methods. The code is available at

*Alan de Aguiar,Michaella Pereira Andrade,Charles Morphy D. Santos,João Paulo Gois*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了HideAndSeg工具，这是一种新型的、最小监督的基于AI的工具，用于分割章鱼视频。通过整合SAM2和YOLOv11，减少手动干预，实现了自动化的管道。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于章鱼的自然栖息地研究具有挑战性，包括其伪装能力、快速变化的皮肤纹理和颜色、非刚体变形以及频繁的遮挡，水下照明和浑浊度也增加了难度。该论文旨在解决缺乏大规模标注数据集的问题。

Method: HideAndSeg整合了SAM2和定制训练的YOLOv11目标检测器。用户首先提供点坐标以生成初始分割掩码，然后这些掩码作为YOLO模型的训练数据。之后，通过提供边界框提示给SAM2，实现了全自动的管道。引入了两个无监督指标——时间一致性DICE_t和新组件计数NC_t——以在没有真实数据的情况下定量评估分割质量并指导掩码细化。

Result: HideAndSeg取得了令人满意的性能，与手动提示方法相比减少了分割噪声。该方法即使在完全遮挡后也能重新识别和分割章鱼，而手动提示模型在此场景下失败。

Conclusion: 通过减少在真实场景中手动分析的需求，该工作提供了一个实用工具，为更高效的野生头足类动物行为研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: Analyzing octopuses in their natural habitats is challenging due to their
camouflage capability, rapid changes in skin texture and color, non-rigid body
deformations, and frequent occlusions, all of which are compounded by variable
underwater lighting and turbidity. Addressing the lack of large-scale annotated
datasets, this paper introduces HideAndSeg, a novel, minimally supervised
AI-based tool for segmenting videos of octopuses. It establishes a quantitative
baseline for this task. HideAndSeg integrates SAM2 with a custom-trained
YOLOv11 object detector. First, the user provides point coordinates to generate
the initial segmentation masks with SAM2. These masks serve as training data
for the YOLO model. After that, our approach fully automates the pipeline by
providing a bounding box prompt to SAM2, eliminating the need for further
manual intervention. We introduce two unsupervised metrics - temporal
consistency $DICE_t$ and new component count $NC_t$ - to quantitatively
evaluate segmentation quality and guide mask refinement in the absence of
ground-truth data, i.e., real-world information that serves to train, validate,
and test AI models. Results show that HideAndSeg achieves satisfactory
performance, reducing segmentation noise compared to the manually prompted
approach. Our method can re-identify and segment the octopus even after periods
of complete occlusion in natural environments, a scenario in which the manually
prompted model fails. By reducing the need for manual analysis in real-world
scenarios, this work provides a practical tool that paves the way for more
efficient behavioral studies of wild cephalopods.

Conclusion: 这项工作显著扩展了计算处理的拼图类型，为凸多边形拼图的求解提供了有效方法，并为未来研究建立了基准。

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving requires the rearrangement of unordered pieces into
their original pose in order to reconstruct a coherent whole, often an image,
and is known to be an intractable problem. While the possible impact of
automatic puzzle solvers can be disruptive in various application domains, most
of the literature has focused on developing solvers for square jigsaw puzzles,
severely limiting their practical use. In this work, we significantly expand
the types of puzzles handled computationally, focusing on what is known as
Convex Partitions, a major subset of polygonal puzzles whose pieces are convex.
We utilize both geometrical and pictorial compatibilities, introduce a greedy
solver, and report several performance measures next to the first benchmark
dataset of such puzzles.

Conclusion: 该方法为推进图像交互式推理应用提供了有价值的见解，展示了强化学习在多模态推理任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Empowering Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to deeply integrate image
interaction with long-horizon reasoning capabilities remains a long-standing
challenge in this field. Recent advances in vision-centric reasoning explore a
promising "Thinking with Images" paradigm for LMMs, marking a shift from
image-assisted reasoning to image-interactive thinking. While this milestone
enables models to focus on fine-grained image regions, progress remains
constrained by limited visual tool spaces and task-specific workflow designs.
To bridge this gap, we present V-Thinker, a general-purpose multimodal
reasoning assistant that enables interactive, vision-centric thinking through
end-to-end reinforcement learning. V-Thinker comprises two key components: (1)
a Data Evolution Flywheel that automatically synthesizes, evolves, and verifies
interactive reasoning datasets across three dimensions-diversity, quality, and
difficulty; and (2) a Visual Progressive Training Curriculum that first aligns
perception via point-level supervision, then integrates interactive reasoning
through a two-stage reinforcement learning framework. Furthermore, we introduce
VTBench, an expert-verified benchmark targeting vision-centric interactive
reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V-Thinker consistently
outperforms strong LMM-based baselines in both general and interactive
reasoning scenarios, providing valuable insights for advancing
image-interactive reasoning applications.

Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在不同传感器、区域或训练数据有限的情况下表现不佳，需要更可靠的滑坡制图方法以支持灾害应对。

Method: 设计传感器-标签-领域三轴分析框架，基于Prithvi-EO-2.0模型进行全局预训练、自监督学习和自适应微调，并与U-Net、Segformer等模型对比。

Result: GeoFMs模型在光谱变化、标签稀缺和多区域场景下均优于传统CNN与ViT模型，但存在计算成本高、可用训练数据有限的问题。

Conclusion: GeoFMs为滑坡风险降低和环境监测提供了更鲁棒、可扩展的解决方案，是迈向实际应用的重要一步。

Abstract: Landslides cause severe damage to lives, infrastructure, and the environment,
making accurate and timely mapping essential for disaster preparedness and
response. However, conventional deep learning models often struggle when
applied across different sensors, regions, or under conditions of limited
training data. To address these challenges, we present a three-axis analytical
framework of sensor, label, and domain for adapting geospatial foundation
models (GeoFMs), focusing on Prithvi-EO-2.0 for landslide mapping. Through a
series of experiments, we show that it consistently outperforms task-specific
CNNs (U-Net, U-Net++), vision transformers (Segformer, SwinV2-B), and other
GeoFMs (TerraMind, SatMAE). The model, built on global pretraining,
self-supervision, and adaptable fine-tuning, proved resilient to spectral
variation, maintained accuracy under label scarcity, and generalized more
reliably across diverse datasets and geographic settings. Alongside these
strengths, we also highlight remaining challenges such as computational cost
and the limited availability of reusable AI-ready training data for landslide
research. Overall, our study positions GeoFMs as a step toward more robust and
scalable approaches for landslide risk reduction and environmental monitoring.

Conclusion: 提出的基准框架旨在促进生成方法的改进，代码、数据集和排行榜将公开并持续更新以反映领域进展

Abstract: Video generation has achieved remarkable progress, with generated videos
increasingly resembling real ones. However, the rapid advance in generation has
outpaced the development of adequate evaluation metrics. Currently, the
assessment of talking head generation primarily relies on limited metrics,
evaluating general video quality, lip synchronization, and on conducting user
studies. Motivated by this, we propose a new evaluation framework comprising 8
metrics related to three dimensions (i) quality, (ii) naturalness, and (iii)
synchronization. In selecting the metrics, we place emphasis on efficiency, as
well as alignment with human preferences. Based on this considerations, we
streamline to analyze fine-grained dynamics of head, mouth, and eyebrows, as
well as face quality. Our extensive experiments on 85,000 videos generated by
17 state-of-the-art models suggest that while many algorithms excel in lip
synchronization, they face challenges with generating expressiveness and
artifact-free details. These videos were generated based on a novel real
dataset, that we have curated, in order to mitigate bias of training data. Our
proposed benchmark framework is aimed at evaluating the improvement of
generative methods. Original code, dataset and leaderboards will be publicly
released and regularly updated with new methods, in order to reflect progress
in the field.

Motivation: 

Method: 

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: "Thinking with Text" and "Thinking with Images" paradigm significantly
improve the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) and Vision
Language Models (VLMs). However, these paradigms have inherent limitations. (1)
Images capture only single moments and fail to represent dynamic processes or
continuous changes, and (2) The separation of text and vision as distinct
modalities, hindering unified multimodal understanding and generation. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce "Thinking with Video", a new paradigm
that leverages video generation models, such as Sora-2, to bridge visual and
textual reasoning in a unified temporal framework. To support this exploration,
we developed the Video Thinking Benchmark (VideoThinkBench). VideoThinkBench
encompasses two task categories: (1) vision-centric tasks (e.g., Eyeballing
Puzzles), and (2) text-centric tasks (e.g., subsets of GSM8K, MMMU). Our
evaluation establishes Sora-2 as a capable reasoner. On vision-centric tasks,
Sora-2 is generally comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, and even
surpasses VLMs on several tasks, such as Eyeballing Games. On text-centric
tasks, Sora-2 achieves 92% accuracy on MATH, and 75.53% accuracy on MMMU.
Furthermore, we systematically analyse the source of these abilities. We also
find that self-consistency and in-context learning can improve Sora-2's
performance. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the video generation
model is the potential unified multimodal understanding and generation model,
positions "thinking with video" as a unified multimodal reasoning paradigm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确评估手术复杂性对于腹腔镜胆囊切除术至关重要，因为严重炎症与较长手术时间和增加术后并发症风险相关。目前Parkland评分系统的自动化在手术视频中尚未充分探索，特别是在需要分析完整视频而无需人工修剪的现实场景中。

Method: STC-Net框架通过定位、窗口提案和评分模块联合执行时间定位和分级。创新性地结合了硬性和软性定位目标以及背景感知评分监督的损失函数设计，能够在完整视频上直接操作。

Result: 在包含1,859个腹腔镜胆囊切除术视频的私有数据集上评估，STC-Net达到62.11%的准确率和61.42%的F1分数，比非定位基线方法在两个指标上均提高超过10%。

Conclusion: STC-Net展示了从完整手术视频中进行基于PGS的手术复杂性自动化评估的可扩展且有效的方法，在术后分析和手术训练方面具有应用前景。

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate assessment of surgical complexity is essential in
Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LC), where severe inflammation is associated with
longer operative times and increased risk of postoperative complications. The
Parkland Grading Scale (PGS) provides a clinically validated framework for
stratifying inflammation severity; however, its automation in surgical videos
remains largely unexplored, particularly in realistic scenarios where complete
videos must be analyzed without prior manual curation. Methods: In this work,
we introduce STC-Net, a novel framework for SingleTimestamp-based Complexity
estimation in LC via the PGS, designed to operate under weak temporal
supervision. Unlike prior methods limited to static images or manually trimmed
clips, STC-Net operates directly on full videos. It jointly performs temporal
localization and grading through a localization, window proposal, and grading
module. We introduce a novel loss formulation combining hard and soft
localization objectives and background-aware grading supervision. Results:
Evaluated on a private dataset of 1,859 LC videos, STC-Net achieves an accuracy
of 62.11% and an F1-score of 61.42%, outperforming non-localized baselines by
over 10% in both metrics and highlighting the effectiveness of weak supervision
for surgical complexity assessment. Conclusion: STC-Net demonstrates a scalable
and effective approach for automated PGS-based surgical complexity estimation
from full LC videos, making it promising for post-operative analysis and
surgical training.

integrate information across spatial views and temporal frames, we introduce an
efficient fusion mechanism that operates directly within the 3D scaffold,
enabling consistent spatio-temporal alignment. To ensure complete and detailed
reconstructions, we design a dual-branch decoder that generates dynamic-aware
Gaussians from the fused scaffold by combining point-anchored refinement with
voxel-based generation, and maintain a persistent memory of static Gaussians to
enable streaming scene completion beyond current camera coverage. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that UniSplat achieves
state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, while providing robust
and high-quality renderings even for viewpoints outside the original camera
coverage.

TL;DR: PixCLIP是一个新颖的框架，通过结合视觉提示输入和处理长文本描述来增强CLIP模型在细粒度图像-文本对齐方面的能力。该框架包括自动注释流水线生成的LongGRIT数据集，以及一个三分支像素-文本对齐学习框架，实现了像素级交互和长文本处理的最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然CLIP模型在下游视觉语言理解任务中取得了显著成功，但增强其细粒度图像-文本对齐能力仍是一个活跃的研究方向。现有工作主要关注增加视觉信息处理的粒度，而多模态大语言模型的研究表明，使用长而详细的文本描述进行训练可以有效改善模型的细粒度视觉-语言对齐。然而，CLIP文本编码器的固有令牌长度限制使其无法处理长文本序列中嵌入的更细粒度的文本信息。

Method: 提出了PixCLIP框架，该框架同时适应视觉提示输入和处理长文本描述。首先建立了一个自动注释流水线，能够为图像生成像素级定位的长格式文本描述，并构建了包含近150万样本的高质量数据集LongGRIT。其次，用LLM替换CLIP的原始文本编码器，并提出了一个三分支像素-文本对齐学习框架，促进图像区域与相应文本描述在任意粒度上的细粒度对齐。

Result: 实验证明，PixCLIP在像素级交互和处理长文本方面展示了突破，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PixCLIP通过协同利用增强视觉和文本内容处理粒度的优势，有效克服了CLIP模型在处理细粒度图像-文本对齐方面的限制，为细粒度视觉-语言理解任务提供了有力的解决方案。

Abstract: While the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining(CLIP) model has achieved
remarkable success in a variety of downstream vison language understanding
tasks, enhancing its capability for fine-grained image-text alignment remains
an active research focus. To this end, most existing works adopt the strategy
of explicitly increasing the granularity of visual information processing,
e.g., incorporating visual prompts to guide the model focus on specific local
regions within the image. Meanwhile, researches on Multimodal Large Language
Models(MLLMs) have demonstrated that training with long and detailed textual
descriptions can effectively improve the model's fine-grained vision-language
alignment. However, the inherent token length limitation of CLIP's text encoder
fundamentally limits CLIP to process more granular textual information embedded
in long text sequences. To synergistically leverage the advantages of enhancing
both visual and textual content processing granularity, we propose PixCLIP, a
novel framework designed to concurrently accommodate visual prompt inputs and
process lengthy textual descriptions. Specifically, we first establish an
automated annotation pipeline capable of generating pixel-level localized,
long-form textual descriptions for images. Utilizing this pipeline, we
construct LongGRIT, a high-quality dataset comprising nearly 1.5 million
samples. Secondly, we replace CLIP's original text encoder with the LLM and
propose a three-branch pixel-text alignment learning framework, facilitating
fine-grained alignment between image regions and corresponding textual
descriptions at arbitrary granularity. Experiments demonstrate that PixCLIP
showcases breakthroughs in pixel-level interaction and handling long-form
texts, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: Introducing an automated, accuracy-grounded evaluation framework for virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) models using stain accuracy metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable evaluation of image quality in virtual IHC remains a challenge, as current metrics focus on image fidelity rather than staining accuracy.

Method: Using color deconvolution to generate IHC-positive pixel masks from virtual and real IHC images, then computing Dice, IoU, and Hausdorff distance metrics.

Result: Conventional image fidelity metrics correlate poorly with stain accuracy and pathologist assessment; paired models achieve higher accuracy than unpaired models.

Conclusion: This framework provides a reproducible approach for assessing virtual IHC model quality, crucial for clinical translation.

Abstract: Deep learning models can generate virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains
from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images, offering a scalable and low-cost
alternative to laboratory IHC. However, reliable evaluation of image quality
remains a challenge as current texture- and distribution-based metrics quantify
image fidelity rather than the accuracy of IHC staining. Here, we introduce an
automated and accuracy grounded framework to determine image quality across
sixteen paired or unpaired image translation models. Using color deconvolution,
we generate masks of pixels stained brown (i.e., IHC-positive) as predicted by
each virtual IHC model. We use the segmented masks of real and virtual IHC to
compute stain accuracy metrics (Dice, IoU, Hausdorff distance) that directly
quantify correct pixel - level labeling without needing expert manual
annotations. Our results demonstrate that conventional image fidelity metrics,
including Frechet Inception Distance (FID), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR),
and structural similarity (SSIM), correlate poorly with stain accuracy and
pathologist assessment. Paired models such as PyramidPix2Pix and AdaptiveNCE
achieve the highest stain accuracy, whereas unpaired diffusion- and GAN-based
models are less reliable in providing accurate IHC positive pixel labels.
Moreover, whole-slide images (WSI) reveal performance declines that are
invisible in patch-based evaluations, emphasizing the need for WSI-level
benchmarks. Together, this framework defines a reproducible approach for
assessing the quality of virtual IHC models, a critical step to accelerate
translation towards routine use by pathologists.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种可扩展的流式视频质量评估(VQA)模型，该模型无需参考视频和无监督，通过利用DAVIS数据集的合成退化训练时域感知卷积架构，直接从退化视频预测全参考指标，在推理时无需参考视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频质量评估方法存在重大局限性：全参考(FR)指标需要干净的参考视频，大多数无参考(NR)模型依赖昂贵的人工标注标签，且大多数无监督NR方法是基于图像的，忽略了视频目标检测中关键的时域上下文。

Method: 使用DAVIS数据集的合成退化训练时域感知卷积架构，直接从退化视频预测全参考指标(LPIPS、PSNR、SSIM)，在推理时无需参考视频。采用流式处理方法。

Result: 流式方法优于图像基线，能够泛化到多样化的退化情况，证明了时域建模对于真实世界视觉系统中可扩展VQA的价值。与广泛使用的BRISQUE图像质量评估基线相比，该模型与全参考指标的相关性更高。

Conclusion: 该研究验证了时域、无监督方法的有效性，为视频质量评估提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，特别适用于缺乏参考视频和人工标注的真实世界应用场景。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is vital for computer vision tasks, but
existing approaches face major limitations: full-reference (FR) metrics require
clean reference videos, and most no-reference (NR) models depend on training on
costly human opinion labels. Moreover, most opinion-unaware NR methods are
image-based, ignoring temporal context critical for video object detection. In
this work, we present a scalable, streaming-based VQA model that is both
no-reference and opinion-unaware. Our model leverages synthetic degradations of
the DAVIS dataset, training a temporal-aware convolutional architecture to
predict FR metrics (LPIPS , PSNR, SSIM) directly from degraded video, without
references at inference. We show that our streaming approach outperforms our
own image-based baseline by generalizing across diverse degradations,
underscoring the value of temporal modeling for scalable VQA in real-world
vision systems. Additionally, we demonstrate that our model achieves higher
correlation with full-reference metrics compared to BRISQUE, a widely-used
opinion-aware image quality assessment baseline, validating the effectiveness
of our temporal, opinion-unaware approach.

TL;DR: 偏振分辨近红外成像通过测量眼组织反射光的偏振状态增强眼动追踪对比度，基于偏振的眼动追踪（PET）系统相比强度基线可将中位95%绝对凝视误差降低10-16%。

Motivation: 为眼动追踪增加有用的光学对比机制，利用偏振状态信息提升追踪精度和鲁棒性。

Method: 使用偏振滤波阵列相机配合线性偏振近红外光源构建PET系统，通过卷积神经网络模型处理偏振图像数据。

Result: 在346名参与者实验中，PET系统在正常条件和眼睑遮挡等场景下，相比强度基线显著降低凝视误差。

Conclusion: 偏振光-组织效应可提升人机交互性能，PET是未来可穿戴设备的简单鲁棒传感方案。

Abstract: Polarization-resolved near-infrared imaging adds a useful optical contrast
mechanism to eye tracking by measuring the polarization state of light
reflected by ocular tissues in addition to its intensity. In this paper we
demonstrate how this contrast can be used to enable eye tracking. Specifically,
we demonstrate that a polarization-enabled eye tracking (PET) system composed
of a polarization--filter--array camera paired with a linearly polarized
near-infrared illuminator can reveal trackable features across the sclera and
gaze-informative patterns on the cornea, largely absent in intensity-only
images. Across a cohort of 346 participants, convolutional neural network based
machine learning models trained on data from PET reduced the median
95th-percentile absolute gaze error by 10--16\% relative to capacity-matched
intensity baselines under nominal conditions and in the presence of eyelid
occlusions, eye-relief changes, and pupil-size variation. These results link
light--tissue polarization effects to practical gains in human--computer
interaction and position PET as a simple, robust sensing modality for future
wearable devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Robust benchmarks are crucial for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). Yet we find that models can ace many multimodal benchmarks without
strong visual understanding, instead exploiting biases, linguistic priors, and
superficial patterns. This is especially problematic for vision-centric
benchmarks that are meant to require visual inputs. We adopt a diagnostic
principle for benchmark design: if a benchmark can be gamed, it will be.
Designers should therefore try to ``game'' their own benchmarks first, using
diagnostic and debiasing procedures to systematically identify and mitigate
non-visual biases. Effective diagnosis requires directly ``training on the test
set'' -- probing the released test set for its intrinsic, exploitable patterns.
  We operationalize this standard with two components. First, we diagnose
benchmark susceptibility using a ``Test-set Stress-Test'' (TsT) methodology.
Our primary diagnostic tool involves fine-tuning a powerful Large Language
Model via $k$-fold cross-validation on exclusively the non-visual, textual
inputs of the test set to reveal shortcut performance and assign each sample a
bias score $s(x)$. We complement this with a lightweight Random Forest-based
diagnostic operating on hand-crafted features for fast, interpretable auditing.
Second, we debias benchmarks by filtering high-bias samples using an
``Iterative Bias Pruning'' (IBP) procedure. Applying this framework to four
benchmarks -- VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, and VideoMME -- we uncover pervasive
non-visual biases. As a case study, we apply our full framework to create
VSI-Bench-Debiased, demonstrating reduced non-visual solvability and a wider
vision-blind performance gap than the original.

Method: 开发SIMS-V数据生成框架，利用3D模拟器生成空间丰富的训练数据，通过系统消融实验分析问题类型、混合方式和规模对真实世界迁移效果的影响。

Result: 识别出三种最有效的问题类别，仅用2.5万模拟示例训练的7B模型在真实世界空间推理基准上超越72B基线，达到与专有模型竞争的性能，且在通用视频理解任务上保持稳健。

Conclusion: 模拟数据可以高效培养可迁移的空间智能，少量精心设计的模拟训练数据就能实现强大的真实世界空间推理能力，同时保持通用视频理解性能。

Abstract: Despite impressive high-level video comprehension, multimodal language models
struggle with spatial reasoning across time and space. While current spatial
training approaches rely on real-world video data, obtaining diverse footage
with precise spatial annotations remains a bottleneck. To alleviate this
bottleneck, we present SIMS-V -- a systematic data-generation framework that
leverages the privileged information of 3D simulators to create spatially-rich
video training data for multimodal language models. Using this framework, we
investigate which properties of simulated data drive effective real-world
transfer through systematic ablations of question types, mixes, and scales. We
identify a minimal set of three question categories (metric measurement,
perspective-dependent reasoning, and temporal tracking) that prove most
effective for developing transferable spatial intelligence, outperforming
comprehensive coverage despite using fewer question types. These insights
enable highly efficient training: our 7B-parameter video LLM fine-tuned on just
25K simulated examples outperforms the larger 72B baseline and achieves
competitive performance with proprietary models on rigorous real-world spatial
reasoning benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates robust generalization,
maintaining performance on general video understanding while showing
substantial improvements on embodied and real-world spatial tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的多模态系统主要测试早期认知阶段，对空间认知的覆盖狭窄，缺乏真正需要世界建模的挑战。作者认为需要转向更全面的空间超感知范式来推动真正的多模态智能发展。

Method: 1) 定义空间超感知的四个认知阶段；2) 开发VSI-SUPER基准测试（VSR和VSC任务）；3) 训练Cambrian-1模型并测试数据扩展极限；4) 提出预测感知方法，使用自监督的下一潜在帧预测器利用预测误差驱动记忆和事件分割。

Result: 1) Cambrian-1在VSI-Bench上取得+30%的绝对改进；2) 但在VSI-SUPER上表现有限，表明仅靠规模扩展不足；3) 预测感知方法在VSI-SUPER上显著优于领先的专有基线模型。

Conclusion: 空间超感知需要能够预见、选择和整理经验的模型，而不仅仅是看到。预测感知为解决这一挑战提供了有前景的路径，模型需要通过预测来主动组织和理解连续的空间体验。

Abstract: We argue that progress in true multimodal intelligence calls for a shift from
reactive, task-driven systems and brute-force long context towards a broader
paradigm of supersensing. We frame spatial supersensing as four stages beyond
linguistic-only understanding: semantic perception (naming what is seen),
streaming event cognition (maintaining memory across continuous experiences),
implicit 3D spatial cognition (inferring the world behind pixels), and
predictive world modeling (creating internal models that filter and organize
information). Current benchmarks largely test only the early stages, offering
narrow coverage of spatial cognition and rarely challenging models in ways that
require true world modeling. To drive progress in spatial supersensing, we
present VSI-SUPER, a two-part benchmark: VSR (long-horizon visual spatial
recall) and VSC (continual visual spatial counting). These tasks require
arbitrarily long video inputs yet are resistant to brute-force context
expansion. We then test data scaling limits by curating VSI-590K and training
Cambrian-S, achieving +30% absolute improvement on VSI-Bench without
sacrificing general capabilities. Yet performance on VSI-SUPER remains limited,
indicating that scale alone is insufficient for spatial supersensing. We
propose predictive sensing as a path forward, presenting a proof-of-concept in
which a self-supervised next-latent-frame predictor leverages surprise
(prediction error) to drive memory and event segmentation. On VSI-SUPER, this
approach substantially outperforms leading proprietary baselines, showing that
spatial supersensing requires models that not only see but also anticipate,
select, and organize experience.

Abstract: We introduce InfinityStar, a unified spacetime autoregressive framework for
high-resolution image and dynamic video synthesis. Building on the recent
success of autoregressive modeling in both vision and language, our purely
discrete approach jointly captures spatial and temporal dependencies within a

Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfinityStar scores 83.74 on VBench,
outperforming all autoregressive models by large margins, even surpassing some

Abstract: Real-world objects frequently undergo state transformations. From an apple
being cut into pieces to a butterfly emerging from its cocoon, tracking through
these changes is important for understanding real-world objects and dynamics.
However, existing methods often lose track of the target object after
transformation, due to significant changes in object appearance. To address
this limitation, we introduce the task of Track Any State: tracking objects
through transformations while detecting and describing state changes,
accompanied by a new benchmark dataset, VOST-TAS. To tackle this problem, we
present TubeletGraph, a zero-shot system that recovers missing objects after
transformation and maps out how object states are evolving over time.
TubeletGraph first identifies potentially overlooked tracks, and determines
whether they should be integrated based on semantic and proximity priors. Then,
it reasons about the added tracks and generates a state graph describing each
observed transformation. TubeletGraph achieves state-of-the-art tracking
performance under transformations, while demonstrating deeper understanding of
object transformations and promising capabilities in temporal grounding and
semantic reasoning for complex object transformations. Code, additional
results, and the benchmark dataset are available at

Motivation: LLM在生成过程中表现出隐性人格特征，但目前缺乏可靠的方法来控制或对齐这些特质。需要开发有效的机制来在生成过程中操纵模型行为，人格感知的LLM是实现这一目标的有前景的方向。

Conclusion: 该方法为心理理论与实际模型对齐之间搭建了桥梁，证明了人格特质表示可以有效地用于引导模型行为，为实现LLM人格控制提供了可行的技术路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models exhibit implicit personalities in their generation, but
reliably controlling or aligning these traits to meet specific needs remains an
open challenge. The need for effective mechanisms for behavioural manipulation
of the model during generation is a critical gap in the literature that needs
to be fulfilled. Personality-aware LLMs hold a promising direction towards this
objective. However, the relationship between these psychological constructs and
their representations within LLMs remains underexplored and requires further
investigation. Moreover, it is intriguing to understand and study the use of
these representations to steer the models' behaviour. We propose a novel
pipeline that extracts hidden state activations from transformer layers using
the Big Five Personality Traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion,
Agreeableness and Neuroticism), which is a comprehensive and empirically
validated framework to model human personality applies low-rank subspace
discovery methods, and identifies trait-specific optimal layers across
different model architectures for robust injection. The resulting
personality-aligned directions are then operationalised through a flexible
steering framework with dynamic layer selection, enabling precise control of
trait expression in LLM outputs. Our findings reveal that personality traits
occupy a low-rank shared subspace, and that these latent structures can be
transformed into actionable mechanisms for effective steering through careful
perturbations without impacting the fluency, variance and general capabilities,
helping to bridge the gap between psychological theory and practical model
alignment.

Conclusion: TextualVerifier是首个基于LLM技术的TextGrad自我验证框架，无需数值梯度即可实现更可靠的推理，为文本优化验证开辟了新方向

Abstract: TextGrad is a novel approach to text-based automatic differentiation that
enables composite AI systems to perform optimization without explicit numerical
equations. However, it currently lacks self-verification mechanisms that ensure
reasoning validity in text-based decision making. This research introduces
TextualVerifier, a verification framework that leverages chain-of-thought
reasoning and majority voting with large language models to address this
verification gap. TextualVerifier implements a four-stage workflow:
chain-of-thought decomposition, variant generation, majority voting, and
consensus aggregation. It integrates non-invasively with TextGrad at both the
loss function and optimization result verification stages. Experimental
evaluation using the Gemini 1.5 Pro model is conducted in two phases: (1)
standalone evaluation on PRM800K, and (2) integrated evaluation with TextGrad
on GPQA-Diamond, MMLU-ML, and MMLU-CP benchmarks. Results show statistically
significant improvements (p < 0.001). In phase one, TextualVerifier improves
the validity of reasoning steps by 29 percent. In phase two, integration into
TextGrad loss function yields a 2.2 percentage point gain from 68.2 to 70.4
percent with a moderate overhead of 5.9 LLM calls on average. Further
evaluations of TextualVerifier versioning yield 8.08, 10.71, and 3.92
percentage point improvements on GPQA, MMLU-ML, and MMLU-CP respectively.
TextualVerifier thus presents the first self-verification framework for
TextGrad through LLM-based techniques without requiring numerical gradients,
enabling more reliable reasoning and opening new directions for verification in
text-based optimization.

Result: 构建了包含10种希腊方言变体、总计6,374,939词的数据集，这是迄今为止规模最大、变体最多的希腊方言数据集。

Conclusion: GRDD+数据集为希腊方言研究提供了重要资源，通过微调实验可以评估方言数据对LLM性能的影响，为多方言语言模型开发提供参考。

Abstract: We present an extended Greek Dialectal Dataset (GRDD+) 1that complements the
existing GRDD dataset with more data from Cretan, Cypriot, Pontic and Northern
Greek, while we add six new varieties: Greco-Corsican, Griko (Southern Italian
Greek), Maniot, Heptanesian, Tsakonian, and Katharevusa Greek. The result is a
dataset with total size 6,374,939 words and 10 varieties. This is the first
dataset with such variation and size to date. We conduct a number of
fine-tuning experiments to see the effect of good quality dialectal data on a
number of LLMs. We fine-tune three model architectures (Llama-3-8B,
Llama-3.1-8B, Krikri-8B) and compare the results to frontier models
(Claude-3.7-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5, ChatGPT-5).

TL;DR: 为提升低资源粤语自动语音识别(ASR)效果，CantoASR框架通过Whisper模型与大型音频语言模型(LALM)协同，结合强制对齐和韵律感知校正，显著降低字符错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 粤语ASR面临标注数据稀缺、六声调、变调和口音差异等挑战，现有模型如Whisper错误率较高，需融合声学线索与上下文推理以提升性能。

Method: 提出CantoASR框架：1）强制对齐提取声学特征；2）LoRA微调Whisper增强音调辨别；3）指令调优Qwen-Audio实现韵律感知校正。

Result: 在自发粤语数据上评估，相较Whisper-Large-V3取得显著字符错误率(CER)提升。

Conclusion: 声学线索与LALM推理结合，为低资源声调方言ASR提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is critical for language accessibility,
yet low-resource Cantonese remains challenging due to limited annotated data,
six lexical tones, tone sandhi, and accent variation. Existing ASR models, such
as Whisper, often suffer from high word error rates. Large audio-language
models (LALMs), in contrast, can leverage broader contextual reasoning but
still require explicit tonal and prosodic acoustic cues. We introduce CantoASR,
a collaborative ASR-LALM error correction framework that integrates forced
alignment for acoustic feature extraction, a LoRA-finetuned Whisper for
improved tone discrimination, and an instruction-tuned Qwen-Audio for
prosody-aware correction. Evaluations on spontaneous Cantonese data show
substantial CER gains over Whisper-Large-V3. These findings suggest that
integrating acoustic cues with LALM reasoning provides a scalable strategy for
low-resource tonal and dialectal ASR.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) play a central role in modern artificial
intelligence, yet their development has been primarily focused on English,
resulting in limited support for other languages. We present PLLuM (Polish
Large Language Model), the largest open-source family of foundation models
tailored specifically for the Polish language. Developed by a consortium of
major Polish research institutions, PLLuM addresses the need for high-quality,
transparent, and culturally relevant language models beyond the English-centric
commercial landscape. We describe the development process, including the
construction of a new 140-billion-token Polish text corpus for pre-training, a
77k custom instructions dataset, and a 100k preference optimization dataset. A
key component is a Responsible AI framework that incorporates strict data
governance and a hybrid module for output correction and safety filtering. We
detail the models' architecture, training procedures, and alignment techniques
for both base and instruction-tuned variants, and demonstrate their utility in
a downstream task within public administration. By releasing these models
publicly, PLLuM aims to foster open research and strengthen sovereign AI
technologies in Poland.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STARS是一种解码时算法，通过分段采样和拒绝/接受机制在推理阶段优化LLM对齐，比传统微调方法更高效且效果更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型对齐方法（如微调）计算成本高且效果不佳，而推理时方法如Best-of-N采样计算量不切实际，需要更高效的替代方案。

Method: STARS算法在解码时迭代采样、评分和拒绝/接受固定长度的token片段，通过早期纠正生成路径来提升对齐质量。

Result: 在六个LLM上的实验显示，STARS在胜率上比SFT提升最高14.9个百分点，比DPO提升最高4.3个百分点，与Best-of-N基线竞争力相当。

Conclusion: 细粒度的奖励引导采样可作为传统微调和全序列排序方法的通用、鲁棒且高效的替代方案，用于LLM对齐。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human values is crucial for their safe
deployment; however, existing methods, such as fine-tuning, are computationally
expensive and suboptimal. In contrast, inference-time approaches like Best-of-N
sampling require practically infeasible computation to achieve optimal
alignment. We propose STARS: Segment-level Token Alignment with Rejection
Sampling, a decoding-time algorithm that steers model generation by iteratively
sampling, scoring, and rejecting/accepting short, fixed-size token segments.
This allows for early correction of the generation path, significantly
improving computational efficiency and boosting alignment quality. Across a
suite of six LLMs, we show that STARS outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
by up to 14.9 percentage points and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by up
to 4.3 percentage points on win-rates, while remaining highly competitive with
strong Best-of-N baselines. Our work establishes granular, reward-guided
sampling as a generalizable, robust, and efficient alternative to traditional
fine-tuning and full-sequence ranking methods for aligning LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该方法将多标签文本分类任务重新表述为一系列二分决策，通过独立查询每个目标维度并结合前缀缓存机制，在保持准确性的同时显著提升了短文本推理的效率。研究通过情感文本分析验证了该方法的有效性，并通过LLM-to-SLM蒸馏技术将DeepSeek-V3的标注知识迁移到更小的模型中，展示了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多标签分类方法在处理多维度标签时效率较低，尤其是使用大型语言模型时。研究旨在开发一种高效的LLM多标签分类框架，通过任务分解和优化推理过程来解决效率问题。

Method: 1. 将多标签分类重构为序列化二分决策查询；2. 采用前缀缓存机制加速短文本推理；3. 使用LLM-to-SLM蒸馏技术：用DeepSeek-V3生成多标注，聚合后微调小模型（HerBERT-Large等）；4. 在24维情感分析任务上验证方法。

Result: 微调后的小模型在训练过的维度上相比零样本基线有显著提升，同时保持了与原始LLM相当的准确性。前缀缓存机制带来了可观的效率增益，特别是在短文本推理场景中。

Conclusion: 将多标签分类分解为二分查询，结合蒸馏和缓存感知推理，为基于LLM的分类提供了一个可扩展且有效的框架。虽然验证于情感分析领域，但该方法具有跨领域通用性。

Abstract: We introduce a method for efficient multi-label text classification with
large language models (LLMs), built on reformulating classification tasks as
sequences of dichotomic (yes/no) decisions. Instead of generating all labels in
a single structured response, each target dimension is queried independently,
which, combined with a prefix caching mechanism, yields substantial efficiency
gains for short-text inference without loss of accuracy. To demonstrate the
approach, we focus on affective text analysis, covering 24 dimensions including
emotions and sentiment. Using LLM-to-SLM distillation, a powerful annotator
model (DeepSeek-V3) provides multiple annotations per text, which are
aggregated to fine-tune smaller models (HerBERT-Large, CLARIN-1B, PLLuM-8B,
Gemma3-1B). The fine-tuned models show significant improvements over zero-shot
baselines, particularly on the dimensions seen during training. Our findings
suggest that decomposing multi-label classification into dichotomic queries,
combined with distillation and cache-aware inference, offers a scalable and
effective framework for LLM-based classification. While we validate the method
on affective states, the approach is general and applicable across domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着低资源语言被纳入NLP研究，大规模数据收集往往重数量轻质量，可能导致技术性能差和传播社会偏见的有害内容。

Method: 通过分析三种低资源语言的机器翻译数据集，重点关注数据中的性别表征，包括人名、动词性别和刻板印象描绘。

Result: 发现训练数据中政治和宗教领域文本占比大，而基准数据集集中在新闻、健康和体育领域；存在严重的男性偏向；有害和毒性内容在数据量最大的语言中最明显。

Conclusion: 数据数量不能保证质量，需要更早地缓解低资源语言数据集中的有害内容，并激发对该领域数据集质量的进一步研究。

Abstract: As low-resourced languages are increasingly incorporated into NLP research,
there is an emphasis on collecting large-scale datasets. But in prioritizing
quantity over quality, we risk 1) building language technologies that perform
poorly for these languages and 2) producing harmful content that perpetuates
societal biases. In this paper, we investigate the quality of Machine
Translation (MT) datasets for three low-resourced languages--Afan Oromo,
Amharic, and Tigrinya, with a focus on the gender representation in the
datasets. Our findings demonstrate that while training data has a large
representation of political and religious domain text, benchmark datasets are
focused on news, health, and sports. We also found a large skew towards the
male gender--in names of persons, the grammatical gender of verbs, and in
stereotypical depictions in the datasets. Further, we found harmful and toxic
depictions against women, which were more prominent for the language with the
largest amount of data, underscoring that quantity does not guarantee quality.
We hope that our work inspires further inquiry into the datasets collected for
low-resourced languages and prompts early mitigation of harmful content.

TL;DR: GRAPH-RETRIEVED ADAPTIVE DECODING (GRAD) improves LLM truthfulness by using corpus-derived token transition graphs to guide generation, significantly reducing hallucination without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决大型语言模型（LLM）中的幻觉问题，现有方法通常依赖外部知识源，但提示式方法脆弱且依赖领域，符号化知识整合则成本高昂。受知识图谱启发，作者希望找到一种轻量级的方法，能在解码时利用语料证据来引导生成。

Method: GRAD构建稀疏的令牌转移图，通过对小型检索语料库进行单次前向传递来累积下一个令牌的logits。在解码过程中，图检索到的logits经过最大归一化处理，并与模型logits自适应融合，以偏向高证据的续写，同时保持流畅性。

Result: 在三个模型和多个问答基准测试中，GRAD一致优于基线方法，内在准确率提高9.7%，幻觉率降低8.6%，正确性提高6.9%，并在真实性与信息性乘积得分上达到最高。

Conclusion: GRAD提供了一种轻量级、即插即用的替代方案，证明了基于语料级令牌转移的统计证据可以有效引导生成更真实且可验证的输出，优于对比解码和知识图谱增强方法。

Abstract: Hallucination mitigation remains a persistent challenge for large language
models (LLMs), even as model scales grow. Existing approaches often rely on
external knowledge sources, such as structured databases or knowledge graphs,
accessed through prompting or retrieval. However, prompt-based grounding is
fragile and domain-sensitive, while symbolic knowledge integration incurs heavy
retrieval and formatting costs. Motivated by knowledge graphs, we introduce
Graph-Retrieved Adaptive Decoding (GRAD), a decoding-time method that grounds
generation in corpus-derived evidence without retraining. GRAD constructs a
sparse token transition graph by accumulating next-token logits across a small
retrieved corpus in a single forward pass. During decoding, graph-retrieved
logits are max-normalized and adaptively fused with model logits to favor
high-evidence continuations while preserving fluency. Across three models and a
range of question-answering benchmarks spanning intrinsic, extrinsic
hallucination, and factuality tasks, GRAD consistently surpasses baselines,
achieving up to 9.7$\%$ higher intrinsic accuracy, 8.6$\%$ lower hallucination
rates, and 6.9$\%$ greater correctness compared to greedy decoding, while
attaining the highest truth--informativeness product score among all methods.
GRAD offers a lightweight, plug-and-play alternative to contrastive decoding
and knowledge graph augmentation, demonstrating that statistical evidence from
corpus-level token transitions can effectively steer generation toward more
truthful and verifiable outputs.

Motivation: 研究在多轮语言环境中测试智能体的情境敏感性实用推理能力。迭代参考游戏提供了一个测试平台来评估智能体如何使用上下文进行语言推理。

Method: 采用迭代参考游戏实验范式，通过改变上下文的数量、顺序和相关性来测试人类和视觉语言模型在识别新颖指称物任务中的表现。

Result: 在无相关上下文条件下，模型表现仅略高于随机水平，明显低于人类。但在有相关上下文条件下，模型性能随着试验轮次显著提升。包含抽象指称物的少样本参考游戏对机器学习模型仍是挑战。

Conclusion: 迭代参考游戏是评估情境敏感性实用推理的有效测试平台。当前视觉语言模型依赖于相关上下文才能达到良好性能，在处理抽象指称物时仍存在困难。

Abstract: Iterated reference games - in which players repeatedly pick out novel
referents using language - present a test case for agents' ability to perform
context-sensitive pragmatic reasoning in multi-turn linguistic environments. We
tested humans and vision-language models on trials from iterated reference
games, varying the given context in terms of amount, order, and relevance.
Without relevant context, models were above chance but substantially worse than
humans. However, with relevant context, model performance increased
dramatically over trials. Few-shot reference games with abstract referents
remain a difficult task for machine learning models.

Abstract: Quantifying human flourishing, a multidimensional construct including
happiness, health, purpose, virtue, relationships, and financial stability, is
critical for understanding societal well-being beyond economic indicators.
Existing measures often lack fine spatial and temporal resolution. Here we
introduce the Human Flourishing Geographic Index (HFGI), derived from analyzing
approximately 2.6 billion geolocated U.S. tweets (2013-2023) using fine-tuned
large language models to classify expressions across 48 indicators aligned with
Harvard's Global Flourishing Study framework plus attitudes towards migration
and perception of corruption. The dataset offers monthly and yearly county- and
state-level indicators of flourishing-related discourse, validated to confirm
that the measures accurately represent the underlying constructs and show
expected correlations with established indicators. This resource enables
multidisciplinary analyses of well-being, inequality, and social change at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多智能体设置中，语言模型通过普通令牌传递消息会丢弃大部分潜在语义信息，这限制了信息传输并增加了不必要的计算开销。作者希望探索更高效的跨模型语义通信方式。

Method: 使用双编码器翻译器在Llama-2-7B和Mistral-7B-Instruct模型之间训练向量映射，通过30%混合强度的翻译向量注入来引导目标模型的生成，同时保持对数稳定性。

Result: 训练得到的翻译器实现了平均余弦对齐度0.538，双向评估显示2.01:1的传输不对称性，表明通用模型比指令调优模型产生更具传输性的表示。保守的向量注入方法保持了计算稳定性。

Conclusion: 跨模型潜在通信是可行的，这为构建共享意义而非令牌的协作AI系统奠定了基础，可以实现更高效的语义级信息交换。

Abstract: In multi-agent settings, such as debate, reflection, or tool-calling, large
language models (LLMs) pass messages as plain tokens, discarding most latent
semantics. This constrains information transfer and adds unnecessary
computational overhead. We form a latent bridge via vector translations, which
use learned mappings that enable direct semantic exchange between
representation spaces. A dual-encoder translator trained between Llama-2-7B and
Mistral-7B-Instruct attains an average cosine alignment of 0.538. Injecting the
translated vectors at 30 percent blending strength steers the target model's
generation without destabilizing logits. Bidirectional evaluation shows a
2.01:1 transfer asymmetry, indicating that general-purpose models yield more
transferable representations than instruction-tuned variants. This conservative
injection preserves computational stability while demonstrating that
cross-model latent communication is feasible, enabling collaborative AI systems
that share meaning rather than tokens.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with retrieval -- commonly referred to
as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) -- have demonstrated strong performance
in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, RAG pipelines often fail when retrieved
evidence is incomplete, leaving gaps in the reasoning process. In such cases,
\emph{abductive inference} -- the process of generating plausible missing
premises to explain observations -- offers a principled approach to bridge
these gaps. In this paper, we propose a framework that integrates abductive
inference into retrieval-augmented LLMs. Our method detects insufficient
evidence, generates candidate missing premises, and validates them through
consistency and plausibility checks. Experimental results on abductive
reasoning and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that our approach improves both
answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness. This work highlights abductive
inference as a promising direction for enhancing the robustness and
explainability of RAG systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个弱监督转换器(WST)，用于在存在转录错误的情况下稳健地训练端到端语音识别模型，无需额外的置信度估计或预训练模型。实验表明WST在转录错误率高达70%时仍能保持性能，并优于现有的基于CTC的弱监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于RNN-T的端到端语音识别系统严重依赖大规模高质量的标注数据，而这些数据获取成本高且困难。为了减轻这种依赖，需要开发能够处理转录错误的弱监督方法。

Method: 提出弱监督转换器(WST)，设计了一个灵活的训练图，能够在没有额外置信度估计或辅助预训练模型的情况下，鲁棒地处理转录错误。

Result: 在合成和工业数据集上的实证评估显示，WST在转录错误率高达70%时仍能有效保持性能，一致优于现有的基于CTC的弱监督方法（如BTC和OTC）。

Conclusion: WST在现实ASR场景中具有实际应用价值和鲁棒性，证明了其在处理高错误率转录数据时的有效性。实现将公开提供。

Abstract: The Recurrent Neural Network-Transducer (RNN-T) is widely adopted in
end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks but depends heavily
on large-scale, high-quality annotated data, which are often costly and
difficult to obtain. To mitigate this reliance, we propose a Weakly Supervised
Transducer (WST), which integrates a flexible training graph designed to
robustly handle errors in the transcripts without requiring additional
confidence estimation or auxiliary pre-trained models. Empirical evaluations on
synthetic and industrial datasets reveal that WST effectively maintains
performance even with transcription error rates of up to 70%, consistently
outperforming existing Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based weakly
supervised approaches, such as Bypass Temporal Classification (BTC) and
Omni-Temporal Classification (OTC). These results demonstrate the practical
utility and robustness of WST in realistic ASR settings. The implementation
will be publicly available.

TL;DR: 作者提出了一个名为T-FIX的基准测试，用于评估LLM在知识密集型领域中生成的解释与专家判断的一致性，旨在解决现有评价方法仅关注解释的合理性或内部忠实度，而忽略与专家直觉对齐的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在知识密集型领域（如外科手术、天文学、治疗）的应用中，用户（通常是领域专家）不仅需要答案，还需要有意义的解释。然而，现有的解释评价方法主要强调解释的合理性或内部忠实度，未能捕捉解释内容是否真正符合专家直觉。

Method: 作者在七个知识密集型领域与领域专家合作，开发了新的度量标准，用于测量LLM解释与专家判断的一致性，并形式化了专家对齐作为评价解释的标准。

Result: 通过T-FIX基准测试，作者能够系统地评估LLM生成的解释在专家直觉对齐方面的表现，为解释质量的评估提供了更全面的视角。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了在知识密集型应用中，LLM解释需要与专家直觉对齐的重要性，并提出了一个有效的评估框架来改进解释质量。

Abstract: As LLMs are deployed in knowledge-intensive settings (e.g., surgery,
astronomy, therapy), users expect not just answers, but also meaningful
explanations for those answers. In these settings, users are often domain
experts (e.g., doctors, astrophysicists, psychologists) who require
explanations that reflect expert-level reasoning. However, current evaluation
schemes primarily emphasize plausibility or internal faithfulness of the
explanation, which fail to capture whether the content of the explanation truly
aligns with expert intuition. We formalize expert alignment as a criterion for
evaluating explanations with T-FIX, a benchmark spanning seven
knowledge-intensive domains. In collaboration with domain experts, we develop
novel metrics to measure the alignment of LLM explanations with expert
judgment.

Motivation: 现有的时序知识图谱问答方法未能充分理解时间约束的复杂语义信息，而大语言模型虽然具有良好的语义理解和推理泛化能力，但在时序推理方面存在局限性，容易产生幻觉和知识缺失问题。

Method: 提出Plan of Knowledge（PoK）框架：1）知识规划模块将复杂时间问题分解为子目标序列；2）构建时间知识库（TKS）和对比检索框架，选择性检索与TKGs语义和时间对齐的事实。

Result: 在四个基准TKGQA数据集上的实验表明，PoK显著提升了LLMs的检索精度和推理准确率，相比最先进的TKGQA方法性能提升最高达56.0%。

embeddings or graph neural networks to inject temporal knowledge, they fail to
fully understand the complex semantic information of time constraints.
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress,
benefiting from their strong semantic understanding and reasoning
generalization capabilities. However, their temporal reasoning ability remains
limited. LLMs frequently suffer from hallucination and a lack of knowledge. To
address these limitations, we propose the Plan of Knowledge framework with a
contrastive temporal retriever, which is named PoK. Specifically, the proposed
Plan of Knowledge module decomposes a complex temporal question into a sequence
of sub-objectives from the pre-defined tools, serving as intermediate guidance
for reasoning exploration. In parallel, we construct a Temporal Knowledge Store
(TKS) with a contrastive retrieval framework, enabling the model to selectively
retrieve semantically and temporally aligned facts from TKGs. By combining
structured planning with temporal knowledge retrieval, PoK effectively enhances
the interpretability and factual consistency of temporal reasoning. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark TKGQA datasets demonstrate that PoK significantly
improves the retrieval precision and reasoning accuracy of LLMs, surpassing the
performance of the state-of-the-art TKGQA methods by 56.0% at most.

*Špela Vintar,Jan Jona Javoršek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这是一项比较人类和大型语言模型（LLM）在生成词汇联想方面的研究，发现LLM与人类的联想重叠中等，但LLM的联想情绪更强、更可预测且缺乏创造性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类词汇联想反映了心智词典的结构，但可能受个人经历、情绪和认知风格影响。研究旨在比较LLM是否能像人类一样生成联想，特别是对情绪化词汇的反应。

Method: 通过比较人类参与者和LLM对情绪化词汇的联想行为，分析二者的重叠程度、情绪放大效应和创造性差异。

Result: LLM与人类的联想重叠中等，但LLM的联想会放大刺激词的情绪负荷，且更可预测、缺乏创造性。

Conclusion: LLM在词汇联想上表现出与人类相似但情绪放大、创造性不足的特点，揭示了其与人类心智词典的差异。

Abstract: Human word associations are a well-known method of gaining insight into the
internal mental lexicon, but the responses spontaneously offered by human
participants to word cues are not always predictable as they may be influenced
by personal experience, emotions or individual cognitive styles. The ability to
form associative links between seemingly unrelated concepts can be the driving
mechanisms of creativity. We perform a comparison of the associative behaviour
of humans compared to large language models. More specifically, we explore
associations to emotionally loaded words and try to determine whether large
language models generate associations in a similar way to humans. We find that
the overlap between humans and LLMs is moderate, but also that the associations
of LLMs tend to amplify the underlying emotional load of the stimulus, and that
they tend to be more predictable and less creative than human ones.

TL;DR: 本文开发了一种基于Transformer的医疗信息去识别模型，通过在斯坦福大学两个大型标注放射学数据集上训练，引入新的AGE类别，在多个测试集上表现优异，显著优于商业系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 基于最先进的Transformer PHI去识别流水线，在斯坦福大学大型放射学语料库上进行微调，引入新的AGE PHI类别。采用'隐藏于众目睽睽之下'方法评估合成PHI生成稳定性，并与商业系统进行性能对比。

Result: 模型在宾大数据集上F1得分0.973，斯坦福数据集上0.996，优于或保持先前最先进模型性能。对合成PHI检测表现出稳定性（总体F1: 0.959），在合成报告上显著优于所有供应商系统（F1: 0.960 vs. 0.632-0.754）。

Conclusion: 大规模多模式训练改善了跨机构泛化能力和鲁棒性。基于Transformer的去识别模型在PHI检测方面优于所有先前学术和商业系统，为安全临床文本处理建立了新基准。

Abstract: Objective: To enhance automated de-identification of radiology reports by
scaling transformer-based models through extensive training datasets and
benchmarking performance against commercial cloud vendor systems for protected
health information (PHI) detection. Materials and Methods: In this
retrospective study, we built upon a state-of-the-art, transformer-based, PHI
de-identification pipeline by fine-tuning on two large annotated radiology
corpora from Stanford University, encompassing chest X-ray, chest CT,
abdomen/pelvis CT, and brain MR reports and introducing an additional PHI
category (AGE) into the architecture. Model performance was evaluated on test
sets from Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) for token-level
PHI detection. We further assessed (1) the stability of synthetic PHI
generation using a "hide-in-plain-sight" method and (2) performance against
commercial systems. Precision, recall, and F1 scores were computed across all
PHI categories. Results: Our model achieved overall F1 scores of 0.973 on the
Penn dataset and 0.996 on the Stanford dataset, outperforming or maintaining
the previous state-of-the-art model performance. Synthetic PHI evaluation
showed consistent detectability (overall F1: 0.959 [0.958-0.960]) across 50
independently de-identified Penn datasets. Our model outperformed all vendor
systems on synthetic Penn reports (overall F1: 0.960 vs. 0.632-0.754).
Discussion: Large-scale, multimodal training improved cross-institutional
generalization and robustness. Synthetic PHI generation preserved data utility
while ensuring privacy. Conclusion: A transformer-based de-identification model
trained on diverse radiology datasets outperforms prior academic and commercial
systems in PHI detection and establishes a new benchmark for secure clinical
text processing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究重新探讨了语言识别在极限中的问题，通过引入列表猜测机制，提出了k-列表识别的精确特征刻画，并建立了在统计设置下的识别速率界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典的语言识别在极限中对于任何有趣的语言集合都是不可能的。受最近语言生成相关积极结果的启发，本研究旨在重新探讨该问题，通过赋予学习者每次产生k个猜测的能力来增强其识别能力。

Method: 基于Angluin的特征刻画，提出递归版本的特征刻画方法，并证明语言集合可k-列表识别的充要条件是该集合可分解为k个可识别子集。在统计设置中分析识别速率。

Result: 给出了语言集合可k-列表识别的精确特征刻画，证明可k-列表识别的集合能以指数速率被识别，且这是最优的；而不可k-列表识别的集合无法以任何趋于零的速率被识别。

Conclusion: 本研究扩展了经典语言识别理论，通过列表猜测机制实现了更广泛的语言集合识别，并建立了统计设置下的最优识别速率界限，为语言识别理论提供了新的洞见。

Abstract: We study the problem of language identification in the limit, where given a
sequence of examples from a target language, the goal of the learner is to
output a sequence of guesses for the target language such that all the guesses
beyond some finite time are correct. Classical results of Gold showed that
language identification in the limit is impossible for essentially any
interesting collection of languages. Later, Angluin gave a precise
characterization of language collections for which this task is possible.
Motivated by recent positive results for the related problem of language
generation, we revisit the classic language identification problem in the
setting where the learner is given the additional power of producing a list of
$k$ guesses at each time step. The goal is to ensure that beyond some finite
time, one of the guesses is correct at each time step.
  We give an exact characterization of collections of languages that can be
$k$-list identified in the limit, based on a recursive version of Angluin's
characterization (for language identification with a list of size $1$). This
further leads to a conceptually appealing characterization: A language
collection can be $k$-list identified in the limit if and only if the
collection can be decomposed into $k$ collections of languages, each of which
can be identified in the limit (with a list of size $1$). We also use our
characterization to establish rates for list identification in the statistical
setting where the input is drawn as an i.i.d. stream from a distribution
supported on some language in the collection. Our results show that if a
collection is $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then the collection can be
$k$-list identified at an exponential rate, and this is best possible. On the
other hand, if a collection is not $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then it
cannot be $k$-list identified at any rate that goes to zero.

TL;DR: 批处理不仅可以降低LLM推理成本，还能显著提高大型推理模型在多步推理中的准确性和效率，减少推理令牌使用，抑制过度思考，并产生集体效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索批处理在大型语言模型中的额外好处，特别是其对多步推理行为的正则化作用，而不仅仅是作为吞吐量优化的手段。

Method: 在13个不同的基准测试上进行综合研究，通过详细的行为分析评估批处理对模型推理行为的影响。

Result: 批处理提高了准确性，同时大幅减少了推理令牌的使用（通常减少3-5倍），抑制了过度思考，减少了犹豫语言，并鼓励了更果断的答案。此外，还观察到批处理推理中的涌现集体效应。

Conclusion: 批处理不仅是一种吞吐量优化手段，更是一种强大的推理时正则化器，能够实现更高效和可靠的LLM推理。

Abstract: Recent work has explored batch prompting as a strategy to amortize inference
cost in large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we show that batching
offers an additional, underappreciated benefit: it regularizes model behavior
during multi-step reasoning for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We conduct a
comprehensive study across 13 diverse benchmarks and observe that batching
improves accuracy while substantially reducing reasoning token usage, often by
3x-5x. Through detailed behavioral analysis, we find that batching suppresses
overthinking, reduces hedging language (e.g., repetitive self-corrections), and
encourages more decisive answers. Surprisingly, we also observe emergent
collective effects in batched inference: models often generalize patterns from
earlier examples to solve harder ones in the same batch. These findings
position batching not just as a throughput optimization, but as a powerful
inference-time regularizer for more efficient and reliable LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了RIDE框架，利用项目反应理论衡量数学问题难度并生成具有挑战性的对抗性问题变体，用以更准确地评估LLMs的真实数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对大语言模型数学推理能力的评估可能因训练数据泄漏或浅层模式匹配而存在夸大，需要一种能够真实衡量推理能力的对抗性评估方法。

Method: 提出RIDE框架，使用35个LLMs模拟学生响应，基于IRT构建难度排名器，通过强化学习指导问题重写模型生成难度可控的数学问题变体。

Result: 在竞赛级数学基准测试中，应用RIDE生成的对抗性问题使得26个先进LLMs性能平均下降21.73%，暴露了模型数学推理能力的鲁棒性限制。

Conclusion: RIDE框架有效揭示了LLMs数学推理能力的局限性，为更准确的数学推理评估提供了验证有效的方法论。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve high performance on mathematical
reasoning, but these results can be inflated by training data leakage or
superficial pattern matching rather than genuine reasoning. To this end, an
adversarial perturbation-based evaluation is needed to measure true
mathematical reasoning ability. Current rule-based perturbation methods often
generate ill-posed questions and impede the systematic evaluation of question
difficulty and the evolution of benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose
RIDE, a novel adversarial question-rewriting framework that leverages Item
Response Theory (IRT) to rigorously measure question difficulty and to generate
intrinsically more challenging, well-posed variations of mathematical problems.
We employ 35 LLMs to simulate students and build a difficulty ranker from their
responses. This ranker provides a reward signal during reinforcement learning
and guides a question-rewriting model to reformulate existing questions across
difficulty levels. Applying RIDE to competition-level mathematical benchmarks
yields perturbed versions that degrade advanced LLM performance, with
experiments showing an average 21.73% drop across 26 models, thereby exposing
limited robustness in mathematical reasoning and confirming the validity of our
evaluation approach.

TL;DR: 该研究探索了三种多智能体LLM流水线来提升小模型在Text-to-SQL任务中的性能，其中规划器-编码器流水线效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在面对大型数据库模式和复杂推理时，Text-to-SQL任务表现不佳，而之前的研究多集中于复杂不实用的旗舰模型流水线，忽略了小型高效模型的潜力。

Method: 提出了三种多智能体流水线：（1）多智能体讨论流水线：智能体迭代批判和优化SQL查询，由裁决者合成最终答案；（2）规划器-编码器流水线：思考模型规划器生成分步SQL生成计划，编码器合成查询；（3）编码器-聚合器流水线：多个编码器独立生成SQL查询，推理智能体选择最佳查询。

Result: 在Bird-Bench Mini-Dev数据集上的实验表明，多智能体讨论可提升小模型性能，Qwen2.5-7b-Instruct经过三轮讨论后执行准确率提升10.6%。规划器-编码器流水线效果最好，DeepSeek-R1-32B和QwQ-32B规划器将Gemma 3 27B IT的准确率从52.4%提升到最高的56.4%。

Conclusion: 多智能体方法可以有效提升小型LLM在Text-to-SQL任务中的性能，特别是规划器-编码器流水线展现出最佳效果，为资源受限环境下的SQL生成提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems provide a natural language interface that can enable even
laymen to access information stored in databases. However, existing Large
Language Models (LLM) struggle with SQL generation from natural instructions
due to large schema sizes and complex reasoning. Prior work often focuses on
complex, somewhat impractical pipelines using flagship models, while smaller,
efficient models remain overlooked. In this work, we explore three multi-agent
LLM pipelines, with systematic performance benchmarking across a range of small
to large open-source models: (1) Multi-agent discussion pipeline, where agents
iteratively critique and refine SQL queries, and a judge synthesizes the final
answer; (2) Planner-Coder pipeline, where a thinking model planner generates
stepwise SQL generation plans and a coder synthesizes queries; and (3)
Coder-Aggregator pipeline, where multiple coders independently generate SQL
queries, and a reasoning agent selects the best query. Experiments on the
Bird-Bench Mini-Dev set reveal that Multi-Agent discussion can improve small
model performance, with up to 10.6% increase in Execution Accuracy for
Qwen2.5-7b-Instruct seen after three rounds of discussion. Among the pipelines,
the LLM Reasoner-Coder pipeline yields the best results, with DeepSeek-R1-32B
and QwQ-32B planners boosting Gemma 3 27B IT accuracy from 52.4% to the highest
score of 56.4%. Codes are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LAAC提出了一种新的通信范式，利用LLM作为智能中介来避免当前AI生成内容中的膨胀-压缩循环问题。通过对信息保真度、可重现性和查询响应完整性三个维度的系统性评估，发现了在关键通信场景部署前需要解决的可信度差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成内容存在通信戏剧化问题 - 发送者用LLM将简单想法膨胀为冗长内容，接收者用LLM压缩回摘要，导致双方都无法接触真实内容。需要构建可信的LLM通信中介来解决这一问题。

Method: 使用受控实验评估LAAC的多智能体架构，系统评估三个可信度维度：信息捕获保真度（意图提取准确性）、可重现性（跨交互实例的一致性）和查询响应完整性（无幻觉的可靠性）。

Result: 初步研究结果揭示了在LAAC可靠部署到关键通信场景之前必须解决的可测量的可信度差距。

Conclusion: 虽然LAAC有潜力实现跨领域的真实通信，但在信息保真度、一致性和可靠性方面仍需解决关键的可信度问题，才能在高风险通信场景中可靠部署。

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated content has created an absurd communication
theater where senders use LLMs to inflate simple ideas into verbose content,
recipients use LLMs to compress them back into summaries, and as a consequence
neither party engage with authentic content. LAAC (LLM as a Communicator)
proposes a paradigm shift - positioning LLMs as intelligent communication
intermediaries that capture the sender's intent through structured dialogue and
facilitate genuine knowledge exchange with recipients. Rather than perpetuating
cycles of AI-generated inflation and compression, LAAC enables authentic
communication across diverse contexts including academic papers, proposals,
professional emails, and cross-platform content generation. However, deploying
LLMs as trusted communication intermediaries raises critical questions about
information fidelity, consistency, and reliability. This position paper
systematically evaluates the trustworthiness requirements for LAAC's deployment
across multiple communication domains. We investigate three fundamental
dimensions: (1) Information Capture Fidelity - accuracy of intent extraction
during sender interviews across different communication types, (2)
Reproducibility - consistency of structured knowledge across multiple
interaction instances, and (3) Query Response Integrity - reliability of
recipient-facing responses without hallucination, source conflation, or
fabrication. Through controlled experiments spanning multiple LAAC use cases,
we assess these trust dimensions using LAAC's multi-agent architecture.
Preliminary findings reveal measurable trust gaps that must be addressed before
LAAC can be reliably deployed in high-stakes communication scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种计算图灵测试框架来验证LLM生成文本的真实性，通过系统比较九种开放权重LLM在五个校准策略下的表现，发现即使经过校准，LLM输出仍与人类文本有明显区别，并揭示了真实性与语义保真度之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前社会科学研究中广泛使用LLM模拟人类行为，但其生成文本的真实性假设缺乏可靠验证。现有验证方法依赖容易出错的人类判断，领域缺乏评估LLM生成文本真实性的可靠工具。

Method: 提出计算图灵测试框架，整合基于BERT的可检测性、语义相似度等聚合指标与可解释语言特征；系统比较九种开放权重LLM在五种校准策略下的表现，基准测试使用X、Bluesky和Reddit的用户互动数据。

Result: 即使经过校准，LLM输出在情感基调和情绪表达方面仍明显区别于人类文本；指令调优模型表现不如基础模型；模型规模扩大不会增强人类相似性；发现真实性与语义保真度之间存在权衡关系。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM模拟提供了可扩展的验证校准框架，同时对LLM当前在捕捉人类交流方面的局限性提出了警示，挑战了文献中的核心假设。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in the social sciences to
simulate human behavior, based on the assumption that they can generate
realistic, human-like text. Yet this assumption remains largely untested.
Existing validation efforts rely heavily on human-judgment-based evaluations --
testing whether humans can distinguish AI from human output -- despite evidence
that such judgments are blunt and unreliable. As a result, the field lacks
robust tools for assessing the realism of LLM-generated text or for calibrating
models to real-world data. This paper makes two contributions. First, we
introduce a computational Turing test: a validation framework that integrates
aggregate metrics (BERT-based detectability and semantic similarity) with
interpretable linguistic features (stylistic markers and topical patterns) to
assess how closely LLMs approximate human language within a given dataset.
Second, we systematically compare nine open-weight LLMs across five calibration
strategies -- including fine-tuning, stylistic prompting, and context retrieval
-- benchmarking their ability to reproduce user interactions on X (formerly
Twitter), Bluesky, and Reddit. Our findings challenge core assumptions in the
literature. Even after calibration, LLM outputs remain clearly distinguishable
from human text, particularly in affective tone and emotional expression.
Instruction-tuned models underperform their base counterparts, and scaling up
model size does not enhance human-likeness. Crucially, we identify a trade-off:
optimizing for human-likeness often comes at the cost of semantic fidelity, and
vice versa. These results provide a much-needed scalable framework for
validation and calibration in LLM simulations -- and offer a cautionary note
about their current limitations in capturing human communication.

Motivation: 评估大语言模型在法律专业考试中的实际能力，探索LLM作为实际考生和自动评估工具的可行性，特别是在波兰公共采购法律领域的应用潜力。

Method: 构建混合信息检索和提取管道，测试多种LLM（包括GPT-4.1、Claude 4 Sonnet等）在闭卷考试和检索增强生成环境下的表现，结合客观知识测试和主观书面判决评估。

Result: 模型在客观知识测试中取得满意成绩，但在书面判决部分全部未通过，'LLM-as-a-judge'评估与官方评审结果存在显著差异。模型表现出幻觉倾向、法律条款引用错误、逻辑论证薄弱等问题。

Conclusion: 尽管技术进步迅速，当前LLM仍无法替代波兰公共采购裁决中的人类法官或独立考官，需要法律专家与技术团队的密切合作来改进模型性能。

Abstract: This study provides an empirical assessment of whether current large language
models (LLMs) can pass the official qualifying examination for membership in
Poland's National Appeal Chamber (Krajowa Izba Odwo{\l}awcza). The authors
examine two related ideas: using LLM as actual exam candidates and applying the
'LLM-as-a-judge' approach, in which model-generated answers are automatically
evaluated by other models. The paper describes the structure of the exam, which
includes a multiple-choice knowledge test on public procurement law and a
written judgment, and presents the hybrid information recovery and extraction
pipeline built to support the models. Several LLMs (including GPT-4.1, Claude 4
Sonnet and Bielik-11B-v2.6) were tested in closed-book and various
Retrieval-Augmented Generation settings. The results show that although the
models achieved satisfactory scores in the knowledge test, none met the passing
threshold in the practical written part, and the evaluations of the
'LLM-as-a-judge' often diverged from the judgments of the official examining
committee. The authors highlight key limitations: susceptibility to
hallucinations, incorrect citation of legal provisions, weaknesses in logical
argumentation, and the need for close collaboration between legal experts and
technical teams. The findings indicate that, despite rapid technological
progress, current LLMs cannot yet replace human judges or independent examiners
in Polish public procurement adjudication.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为REMIND的评估方法，通过分析模型在小规模输入变化下的损失来检测被遗忘数据的残余影响，旨在更敏感地评估机器学习模型的遗忘效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保隐私、安全和监管合规性，需要验证模型是否真正遗忘了目标数据，因为现有评估方法可能忽略语义相似样本中的残余影响。

Method: 设计REMIND方法，分析模型在输入微小变化下的损失模式，揭示单点评估未注意到的模式，仅需基于查询的访问。

Result: 被遗忘数据产生更平坦、较不陡峭的损失景观，而保留或无关数据则呈现更尖锐、更波动模式；REMIND在不同模型、数据集和转述输入下表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: REMIND提供了一个更敏感且可解释的遗忘有效性度量，为语言模型中的遗忘评估提供了可靠框架，提供了关于记忆和遗忘的新视角。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training data
from a model without requiring full retraining. This capability is crucial for
ensuring privacy, safety, and regulatory compliance. Therefore, verifying
whether a model has truly forgotten target data is essential for maintaining
reliability and trustworthiness. However, existing evaluation methods often
assess forgetting at the level of individual inputs. This approach may overlook
residual influence present in semantically similar examples. Such influence can
compromise privacy and lead to indirect information leakage. We propose REMIND
(Residual Memorization In Neighborhood Dynamics), a novel evaluation method
aiming to detect the subtle remaining influence of unlearned data and classify
whether the data has been effectively forgotten. REMIND analyzes the model's
loss over small input variations and reveals patterns unnoticed by single-point
evaluations. We show that unlearned data yield flatter, less steep loss
landscapes, while retained or unrelated data exhibit sharper, more volatile
patterns. REMIND requires only query-based access, outperforms existing methods
under similar constraints, and demonstrates robustness across different models,
datasets, and paraphrased inputs, making it practical for real-world
deployment. By providing a more sensitive and interpretable measure of
unlearning effectiveness, REMIND provides a reliable framework to assess
unlearning in language models. As a result, REMIND offers a novel perspective
on memorization and unlearning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注改进预训练数据集，但缺乏对预训练过程从数据中提取知识和信息的效率评估。本研究旨在量化预训练后数据集剩余的价值。

Method: 使用检索增强生成（RAG）和测试时计算来分析预训练后数据集的价值留存情况。方法包括从标准开源数据集中检索信息，并在MMLU、Math-500和SimpleQA等任务上测试效果。

Result: 在MMLU上检索相当于预训练5倍的计算效率提升；通过测试时解析检索内容，LLaMA 3.1 8B模型在MMLU上获得了10个百分点的性能提升。结果表明预训练方法未能充分利用数据集信息。

Conclusion: 当前的预训练方法未能充分利用现有预训练数据集中的信息，存在显著的改进空间，检索增强技术能有效提取预训练过程遗漏的数据价值。

Abstract: Large language models learn from their vast pre-training corpora, gaining the
ability to solve an ever increasing variety of tasks; yet although researchers
work to improve these datasets, there is little effort to understand how
efficient the pre-training apparatus is at extracting ideas and knowledge from
the data. In this work, we use retrieval augmented generation along with
test-time compute as a way to quantify how much dataset value was left behind
by the process of pre-training, and how this changes across scale. We
demonstrate that pre-training then retrieving from standard and largely
open-sourced datasets results in significant accuracy gains in MMLU, Math-500,
and SimpleQA, which persist through decontamination. For MMLU we observe that
retrieval acts as a ~5x compute multiplier versus pre-training alone. We show
that these results can be further improved by leveraging additional compute at
test time to parse the retrieved context, demonstrating a 10 percentage point
improvement on MMLU for the public LLaMA 3.1 8B model. Overall, our results
suggest that today's pre-training methods do not make full use of the
information in existing pre-training datasets, leaving significant room for
progress.

Abstract: Extracting topics from text has become an essential task, especially with the
rapid growth of unstructured textual data. Most existing works rely on highly
computational methods to address this challenge. In this paper, we argue that
probabilistic and statistical approaches, such as topic modeling (TM), can
offer effective alternatives that require fewer computational resources. TM is
a statistical method that automatically discovers topics in large collections
of unlabeled text; however, it produces topics as distributions of
representative words, which often lack clear interpretability. Our objective is
to perform topic labeling by assigning meaningful labels to these sets of
words. To achieve this without relying on computationally expensive models, we
propose a graph-based approach that not only enriches topic words with
semantically related terms but also explores the relationships among them. By
analyzing these connections within the graph, we derive suitable labels that
accurately capture each topic's meaning. We present a comparative study between
our proposed method and several benchmarks, including ChatGPT-3.5, across two
different datasets. Our method achieved consistently better results than
traditional benchmarks in terms of BERTScore and cosine similarity and produced
results comparable to ChatGPT-3.5, while remaining computationally efficient.
Finally, we discuss future directions for topic labeling and highlight
potential research avenues for enhancing interpretability and automation.

### [92] [SSPO: Subsentence-level Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04256)
*Kun Yang,Zikang chen,Yanmeng Wang,Zhigen Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了SSPO方法，通过在句级别计算重要性比率，平衡GRPO和GSPO的优缺点，避免训练崩溃和采样数据利用率低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLVR算法如GRPO和GSPO分别存在策略更新不稳定和采样数据利用率低的问题，需要一种平衡的解决方案。

Method: SSPO应用句级别重要性比率，并结合句熵调整PPO-CLIP的剪裁边界，鼓励高熵词的探索并限制低熵词的剪裁范围。

Result: SSPO在五个数据集上平均得分46.57，超过GRPO（43.01）和GSPO（44.42），并在三个数据集上取得最优性能。

Conclusion: SSPO通过采用GSPO的优点并避免其缺点，有效利用了生成数据，展示了在LLM后训练中的优势。

Abstract: As a significant part of post-training of the Large Language Models (LLMs),
Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has greatly improved LLMs'
reasoning skills. However, some RLVR algorithms, such as GRPO (Group Relative
Policy Optimization) and GSPO (Group Sequence Policy Optimization), are
observed to suffer from unstable policy updates and low usage of sampling data,
respectively. The importance ratio of GRPO is calculated at the token level,
which focuses more on optimizing a single token. This will be easily affected
by outliers, leading to model training collapse. GSPO proposed the calculation
of the response level importance ratio, which solves the problem of high
variance and training noise accumulation in the calculation of the GRPO
importance ratio. However, since all the response tokens share a common
importance ratio, extreme values can easily raise or lower the overall mean,
leading to the entire response being mistakenly discarded, resulting in a
decrease in the utilization of sampled data. This paper introduces SSPO, which
applies sentence-level importance ratio, taking the balance between GRPO and
GSPO. SSPO not only avoids training collapse and high variance, but also
prevents the whole response tokens from being abandoned by the clipping
mechanism. Furthermore, we apply sentence entropy to PPO-CLIP to steadily
adjust the clipping bounds, encouraging high-entropy tokens to explore and
narrow the clipping range of low-entropy tokens. In particular, SSPO achieves
an average score of 46.57 across five datasets, surpassing GRPO (43.01) and
GSPO (44.42), and wins state-of-the-art performance on three datasets. These
results highlight SSPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data by taking
the essence of GSPO but rejecting its shortcomings.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于学习能力评分和批选择策略的机器翻译数据选择方法，能在少样本场景下实现五倍的数据效率提升和24%的计算效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升机器翻译模型性能的关键在于数据质量及有效的数据选择，当前需要系统性的方法来选择对微调最有价值的数据点。

Method: 通过定义学习能力评分，利用学习模型与预训练参考模型的协同作用评估数据效用，结合考虑数据点间相互依赖关系的批选择策略

Result: 在英语-波斯语等语言对上实验显示，方法比iid基线数据效率提升5倍，使用缓存嵌入时计算效率提升24%，翻译性能优于随机选择

Conclusion: 所提数据选择方法能显著提升机器翻译系统的数据效率和计算效率，同时改善泛化能力，为数据高效型机器翻译提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Data quality and its effective selection are fundamental to improving the
performance of machine translation models, serving as cornerstones for
achieving robust and reliable translation systems. This paper presents a data
selection methodology specifically designed for fine-tuning machine translation
systems, which leverages the synergy between a learner model and a pre-trained
reference model to enhance overall training effectiveness. By defining a
learnability score, our approach systematically evaluates the utility of data
points for training, ensuring that only the most relevant and impactful
examples contribute to the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, our method employs
a batch selection strategy which considers interdependencies among data points,
optimizing the efficiency of the training process while maintaining a focus on
data relevance. Experiments on English to Persian and several other language
pairs using an mBART model fine-tuned on the CCMatrix dataset demonstrate that
our method can achieve up to a fivefold improvement in data efficiency compared
to an iid baseline. Experimental results indicate that our approach improves
computational efficiency by 24 when utilizing cached embeddings, as it requires
fewer training data points. Additionally, it enhances generalization, resulting
in superior translation performance compared to random selection method.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在时间推理方面的能力，通过使用1940年的挪威书籍进行实验，评估模型在不同语言和规模下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索LLMs在处理时间推理任务时的表现，特别是当模型需要以特定历史时间点（如1940年）的视角回答问题时。

Method: 方法包括使用1940年挪威书籍中的琐事问题，用英语和挪威语提示LLMs回答问题，并通过LLM-as-judge和人工检查进行评分。测试了多个模型家族，包括DeepSeek-R1、Gemma3、Qwen3、Llama3.1以及专门为挪威语定制的大型模型。

Result: 结果显示，使用英语提示的效果 consistently 优于挪威语提示，而使用更大的模型能改善结果。这一结果与预期不符，因为挪威语是问题的原始语言。

Conclusion: 结论是LLMs在时间推理任务中的表现受语言和模型规模的影响，英语提示的效果更好，而模型规模的增加有助于提升性能。

Abstract: In this study, we experiment with the ability of LLMs to do temporal
reasoning. Using a Norwegian book from 1940 containing trivia questions, we
prompt the LLMs to answer the questions as if it were 1940. We also pose the
questions in both English and Norwegian. Correct answers are often presented as
sentences, and grading is done by means of LLM-as-judge, with sampled checks by
a native speaker. Prompting in English consistently gave better results than in
Norwegian, an unexpected result. In contrast, using larger LLMs improved
results. We tested the DeepSeek-R1, Gemma3, Qwen3, and Llama3.1 model families,
and also the largest available LLM especially crafted for Norwegian.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了PTTSD框架，这是一个基于概率性文本时间序列的抑郁症检测方法，能够从临床访谈对话中预测PHQ-8评分并建模时间上的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的抑郁症严重程度预测模型缺乏不确定性估计和时间建模能力，而准确且可解释的预测对临床决策至关重要。

Method: PTTSD框架包含序列到序列和序列到单一预测两种变体，结合双向LSTM、自注意力机制、残差连接，以及高斯或学生t分布输出头，通过负对数似然进行训练。

Result: 在E-DAIC和DAIC-WOZ数据集上，PTTSD在纯文本系统中达到最先进性能（E-DAIC上MAE=3.85，DAIC上MAE=3.55），并产生良好校准的预测区间。消融实验证实了注意力和概率建模的价值。

Conclusion: 三部分校准分析和定性案例研究进一步突出了不确定性感知预测的可解释性和临床相关性，表明PTTSD框架具有临床应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable predictions of depression severity are essential
for clinical decision support, yet existing models often lack uncertainty
estimates and temporal modeling. We propose PTTSD, a Probabilistic Textual Time
Series Depression Detection framework that predicts PHQ-8 scores from
utterance-level clinical interviews while modeling uncertainty over time. PTTSD
includes sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-one variants, both combining
bidirectional LSTMs, self-attention, and residual connections with Gaussian or
Student-t output heads trained via negative log-likelihood. Evaluated on E-DAIC
and DAIC-WOZ, PTTSD achieves state-of-the-art performance among text-only
systems (e.g., MAE = 3.85 on E-DAIC, 3.55 on DAIC) and produces well-calibrated
prediction intervals. Ablations confirm the value of attention and
probabilistic modeling, while comparisons with MentalBERT establish generality.
A three-part calibration analysis and qualitative case studies further
highlight the interpretability and clinical relevance of uncertainty-aware
forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注高资源语言，泰语在多模态建模中代表性不足，特别是需要文档结构理解的任务。

Method: 创建包含13个任务类别的人类标注数据集，在零样本设置下评估各种最先进的视觉语言模型，包括专有和开源系统。

Result: 专有模型（如Gemini 2.5 Pro）表现优于开源模型，精细文本识别和手写内容提取是开源模型表现最差的任务。错误分析识别出语言偏差、结构不匹配和幻象内容等关键挑战。

Conclusion: ThaiOCRBench为低资源、文字复杂环境下的视觉语言模型评估提供了标准化框架，并为改进泰语文档理解提供了可行的见解。

Abstract: We present ThaiOCRBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
vision-language models (VLMs) on Thai text-rich visual understanding tasks.
Despite recent progress in multimodal modeling, existing benchmarks
predominantly focus on high-resource languages, leaving Thai underrepresented,
especially in tasks requiring document structure understanding. ThaiOCRBench
addresses this gap by offering a diverse, human-annotated dataset comprising
2,808 samples across 13 task categories. We evaluate a wide range of
state-of-the-art VLMs in a zero-shot setting, spanning both proprietary and
open-source systems. Results show a significant performance gap, with
proprietary models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro) outperforming open-source
counterparts. Notably, fine-grained text recognition and handwritten content
extraction exhibit the steepest performance drops among open-source models.
Through detailed error analysis, we identify key challenges such as language
bias, structural mismatch, and hallucinated content. ThaiOCRBench provides a
standardized framework for assessing VLMs in low-resource, script-complex
settings, and provides actionable insights for improving Thai-language document
understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格推理基准主要测试小规模、同质化表格，无法反映真实世界数据的复杂性，需要更全面的评估标准

Method: 构建RUST-BENCH基准，包含2031个真实表格和7966个问题，覆盖科学（NSF资助记录）和体育（NBA统计数据）两个领域，评估LLM在规模、异质性、领域特异性和推理复杂性方面的表现

Result: 实验表明LLM在处理异构架构和复杂多跳推理方面存在困难，暴露了当前架构和提示策略的局限

Conclusion: RUST-BENCH为推进表格推理研究建立了一个具有挑战性的新测试平台，揭示了当前LLM在真实世界表格推理中的持续弱点

Abstract: Existing tabular reasoning benchmarks mostly test models on small, uniform
tables, underrepresenting the complexity of real-world data and giving an
incomplete view of Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning abilities. Real
tables are long, heterogeneous, and domain-specific, mixing structured fields
with free text and requiring multi-hop reasoning across thousands of tokens. To
address this gap, we introduce RUST-BENCH, a benchmark of 7966 questions from
2031 real-world tables spanning two domains: i) RB-Science (NSF grant records)
and ii) RB-Sports (NBA statistics). Unlike prior work, RUST-BENCH evaluates
LLMs jointly across scale, heterogeneity, domain specificity, and reasoning
complexity. Experiments with open-source and proprietary models show that LLMs
struggle with heterogeneous schemas and complex multi-hop inference, revealing
persistent weaknesses in current architectures and prompting strategies.
RUST-BENCH establishes a challenging new testbed for advancing tabular
reasoning research.

Motivation: 发现文本简化性能与源CEFR等级和目标CEFR等级之间的差异高度相关，由此启发设计多轮简化方法。

Method: 提出两种多轮简化方法：基于规则的简化（MRS-Rule）和联合基于规则与LLM的简化（MRS-Joint），使用GPT-4o生成简化文本。

Result: 提交系统在TSAR-2025共享任务中排名第7（共20支队伍），后续改进证明以LLM简化候选为起点可进一步提升多轮简化性能。

Conclusion: 多轮简化方法，特别是结合规则与LLM的联合方法，能有效提升文本简化性能，其中以LLM简化结果作为简化起点具有进一步优化的潜力。

Abstract: This paper describes the OUNLP system submitted to the TSAR-2025 Shared Task
(Alva-Manchego et al., 2025), designed for readability-controlled text
simplification using LLM-prompting-based generation. Based on the analysis of
prompt-based text simplification methods, we discovered an interesting finding
that text simplification performance is highly related to the gap between the
source CEFR (Arase et al., 2022) level and the target CEFR level. Inspired by
this finding, we propose two multi-round simplification methods and generate
them via GPT-4o: rule-based simplification (MRS-Rule) and jointly rule-based
LLM simplification (MRS-Joint). Our submitted systems ranked 7 out of 20 teams.
Later improvements with MRS-Joint show that taking the LLM simplified
candidates as the starting point could further boost the multi-round
simplification performance.

Motivation: 随着LLMs在人类中心应用中的普及，理解其人格化行为特征对于负责任地开发和部署AI系统至关重要。

Method: 采用BFI-2人格量表框架，对六款LLMs在不同采样温度设置下进行系统性评估，并使用层次聚类方法分析模型特质。

Result: 研究发现五个维度中有四个存在显著差异，其中神经质和外向性受温度调整影响明显。聚类分析表明不同架构模型倾向于形成稳定的人格特质分组。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLMs人格化模式的出现提供了新见解，并为模型调优、选择及AI伦理治理提供了新的视角框架。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to human-centered
applications, understanding their personality-like behaviors is increasingly
important for responsible development and deployment. This paper systematically
evaluates six LLMs, applying the Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2) framework, to
assess trait expressions under varying sampling temperatures. We find
significant differences across four of the five personality dimensions, with
Neuroticism and Extraversion susceptible to temperature adjustments. Further,
hierarchical clustering reveals distinct model clusters, suggesting that
architectural features may predispose certain models toward stable trait
profiles. Taken together, these results offer new insights into the emergence
of personality-like patterns in LLMs and provide a new perspective on model
tuning, selection, and the ethical governance of AI systems. We share the data

TL;DR: 本文提出了RAGalyst，一种自动化、与人类对齐的代理框架，用于严格评估领域特定的RAG系统。框架通过代理管道生成高质量合成QA数据集，优化LLM-as-a-Judge指标，并在三个专业领域验证了RAG性能的高度上下文依赖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统评估框架存在两个主要问题：基于启发式的指标无法捕捉领域特定细微差别，以及LLM-as-a-Judge方法缺乏与人类判断的有效对齐验证。这阻碍了在安全关键领域构建可靠RAG系统。

Method: RAGalyst框架包含：(1)代理管道生成高质量合成QA数据集，包含代理过滤步骤确保数据保真度；(2)通过提示优化改进Answer Correctness和Answerability两个LLM-as-a-Judge指标，使其与人类标注强相关；(3)在军事行动、网络安全和桥梁工程三个领域评估不同RAG组件。

Conclusion: RAGalyst框架的必要性得到验证，它使实践者能够发现领域特定的权衡，并为构建可靠有效的RAG系统做出明智的设计选择。框架已在GitHub上开源。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a critical technique for grounding
Large Language Models (LLMs) in factual evidence, yet evaluating RAG systems in
specialized, safety-critical domains remains a significant challenge. Existing
evaluation frameworks often rely on heuristic-based metrics that fail to
capture domain-specific nuances and other works utilize LLM-as-a-Judge
approaches that lack validated alignment with human judgment. This paper
introduces RAGalyst, an automated, human-aligned agentic framework designed for
the rigorous evaluation of domain-specific RAG systems. RAGalyst features an
agentic pipeline that generates high-quality, synthetic question-answering (QA)
datasets from source documents, incorporating an agentic filtering step to
ensure data fidelity. The framework refines two key LLM-as-a-Judge
metrics-Answer Correctness and Answerability-using prompt optimization to
achieve a strong correlation with human annotations. Applying this framework to
evaluate various RAG components across three distinct domains (military
operations, cybersecurity, and bridge engineering), we find that performance is
highly context-dependent. No single embedding model, LLM, or hyperparameter
configuration proves universally optimal. Additionally, we provide an analysis
on the most common low Answer Correctness reasons in RAG. These findings
highlight the necessity of a systematic evaluation framework like RAGalyst,
which empowers practitioners to uncover domain-specific trade-offs and make
informed design choices for building reliable and effective RAG systems.
RAGalyst is available on our Github.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学报告包含显式和隐式不确定性，前者通过模棱两可的短语表达，后者通过省略推理过程产生，现有规则系统无法充分量化，阻碍了机器可读格式的结构化分析。

Method: 1. 显式不确定性：创建LLM验证的常见模棱两可短语参考排序，将每个发现映射到概率值；2. 隐式不确定性：通过扩展框架系统添加基于14种常见诊断专家定义路径的特征子发现。

Conclusion: 该框架支持不确定性感知的图像分类、忠实诊断推理，并为研究诊断不确定性的临床影响提供了新资源。

Abstract: Radiology reports are invaluable for clinical decision-making and hold great
potential for automated analysis when structured into machine-readable formats.
These reports often contain uncertainty, which we categorize into two distinct
types: (i) Explicit uncertainty reflects doubt about the presence or absence of
findings, conveyed through hedging phrases. These vary in meaning depending on
the context, making rule-based systems insufficient to quantify the level of
uncertainty for specific findings; (ii) Implicit uncertainty arises when
radiologists omit parts of their reasoning, recording only key findings or
diagnoses. Here, it is often unclear whether omitted findings are truly absent
or simply unmentioned for brevity. We address these challenges with a two-part
framework. We quantify explicit uncertainty by creating an expert-validated,
LLM-based reference ranking of common hedging phrases, and mapping each finding
to a probability value based on this reference. In addition, we model implicit
uncertainty through an expansion framework that systematically adds
characteristic sub-findings derived from expert-defined diagnostic pathways for
14 common diagnoses. Using these methods, we release Lunguage++, an expanded,
uncertainty-aware version of the Lunguage benchmark of fine-grained structured
radiology reports. This enriched resource enables uncertainty-aware image
classification, faithful diagnostic reasoning, and new investigations into the
clinical impact of diagnostic uncertainty.

Motivation: 语言模型生成时的token选择可能导致不同推理路径，难以量化不确定性。研究模型是否在生成过程中代表可能的交替路径。

Method: 通过控制隐藏层激活状态来干预模型的推理过程，观察不确定性变化及其对预测效果的影响。

Result: 模型不确定性与其活性可操控性呈现明显相关；当模型尚未确定最终答案时，激活干预最有效；隐藏激活可预测模型未来的输出分布。

Conclusion: 语言模型在隐式表示可能的推理路径，活性干预可用于量化和管理模型在推理过程中的不确定性。

Abstract: When a language model generates text, the selection of individual tokens
might lead it down very different reasoning paths, making uncertainty difficult
to quantify. In this work, we consider whether reasoning language models
represent the alternate paths that they could take during generation. To test
this hypothesis, we use hidden activations to control and predict a language
model's uncertainty during chain-of-thought reasoning. In our experiments, we
find a clear correlation between how uncertain a model is at different tokens,
and how easily the model can be steered by controlling its activations. This
suggests that activation interventions are most effective when there are
alternate paths available to the model -- in other words, when it has not yet
committed to a particular final answer. We also find that hidden activations
can predict a model's future outcome distribution, demonstrating that models
implicitly represent the space of possible paths.

Abstract: We present IntelliProof, an interactive system for analyzing argumentative
essays through LLMs. IntelliProof structures an essay as an argumentation
graph, where claims are represented as nodes, supporting evidence is attached
as node properties, and edges encode supporting or attacking relations. Unlike
existing automated essay scoring systems, IntelliProof emphasizes the user
experience: each relation is initially classified and scored by an LLM, then
visualized for enhanced understanding. The system provides justifications for
classifications and produces quantitative measures for essay coherence. It
enables rapid exploration of argumentative quality while retaining human
oversight. In addition, IntelliProof provides a set of tools for a better
understanding of an argumentative essay and its corresponding graph in natural
language, bridging the gap between the structural semantics of argumentative
essays and the user's understanding of a given text. A live demo and the system

Motivation: 评估LLM代码助手的安全性和现有安全基准对实际模型的影响程度，发现漏洞修补效果不佳。

Method: 提出新的严重性指标Prompt Exposure(PE)，综合考虑漏洞严重性、生成概率和诱导提示词；并基于PE定义Model Exposure(ME)评分来衡量模型漏洞严重程度和普遍性。

Result: 发现即使是最新开源模型在现实使用场景中仍易受早期报告漏洞攻击，安全修补存在明显不足。

Conclusion: 需要基于新提出的PE/ME指标来优先缓解最严重和普遍的漏洞，改进LLM代码生成的安全性。

Abstract: As the role of Large Language Models (LLM)-based coding assistants in
software development becomes more critical, so does the role of the bugs they
generate in the overall cybersecurity landscape. While a number of LLM code
security benchmarks have been proposed alongside approaches to improve the
security of generated code, it remains unclear to what extent they have
impacted widely used coding LLMs. Here, we show that even the latest
open-weight models are vulnerable in the earliest reported vulnerability
scenarios in a realistic use setting, suggesting that the safety-functionality
trade-off has until now prevented effective patching of vulnerabilities. To
help address this issue, we introduce a new severity metric that reflects the
risk posed by an LLM-generated vulnerability, accounting for vulnerability
severity, generation chance, and the formulation of the prompt that induces
vulnerable code generation - Prompt Exposure (PE). To encourage the mitigation
of the most serious and prevalent vulnerabilities, we use PE to define the
Model Exposure (ME) score, which indicates the severity and prevalence of
vulnerabilities a model generates.

BanglaMMedBench, the first large-scale Bangla biomedical Multiple Choice
Question (MCQ) datasets designed to evaluate reasoning and retrieval in medical
artificial intelligence (AI). The study applies and benchmarks several
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategies, including Traditional,
Zero-Shot Fallback, Agentic, Iterative Feedback, and Aggregate RAG, combining
textbook-based and web retrieval with generative reasoning to improve factual
accuracy. A key novelty lies in integrating a Bangla medical textbook corpus
through Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and implementing an Agentic RAG
pipeline that dynamically selects between retrieval and reasoning strategies.
Experimental results show that the Agentic RAG achieved the highest accuracy
89.54% with openai/gpt-oss-120b, outperforming other configurations and
demonstrating superior rationale quality. These findings highlight the
potential of RAG-based methods to enhance the reliability and accessibility of
Bangla medical QA, establishing a foundation for future research in
multilingual medical artificial intelligence.

TL;DR: DeReC是一个轻量级事实核查框架，利用稠密检索分类技术替代计算密集的LLM方法，在保证高精度的同时大幅提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的事实核查系统存在计算成本高、幻觉风险大的问题，需要开发更高效的替代方案。

Method: 结合稠密检索和专门化分类，使用通用文本嵌入替代自回归LLM方法。

Result: 效率提升显著（RAWFC减少95%，LIAR-RAW减少92%），在RAWFC数据集上F1得分65.58%超越现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: 精心设计的检索系统在专业任务中可以匹敌甚至超越LLM性能，同时更具现实部署的实用性。

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation necessitates robust yet computationally
efficient fact verification systems. While current state-of-the-art approaches
leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating explanatory rationales,
these methods face significant computational barriers and hallucination risks
in real-world deployments. We present DeReC (Dense Retrieval Classification), a
lightweight framework that demonstrates how general-purpose text embeddings can
effectively replace autoregressive LLM-based approaches in fact verification
tasks. By combining dense retrieval with specialized classification, our system
achieves better accuracy while being significantly more efficient. DeReC
outperforms explanation-generating LLMs in efficiency, reducing runtime by 95%
on RAWFC (23 minutes 36 seconds compared to 454 minutes 12 seconds) and by 92%
on LIAR-RAW (134 minutes 14 seconds compared to 1692 minutes 23 seconds),
showcasing its effectiveness across varying dataset sizes. On the RAWFC
dataset, DeReC achieves an F1 score of 65.58%, surpassing the state-of-the-art
method L-Defense (61.20%). Our results demonstrate that carefully engineered
retrieval-based systems can match or exceed LLM performance in specialized
tasks while being significantly more practical for real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LEASH是一种训练无需的解码算法，通过监测token级熵的斜率和top-logit边距的改进，自适应地停止推理链生成，以减少计算浪费和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 链式思维提示是大型语言模型复杂推理的关键技术，但生成完整、固定长度的推理过程会导致计算浪费，增加token使用和延迟。

Method: LEASH通过监测两个内在信号：token级熵的斜率和top-logit边距的改进，当这两个信号趋于平稳时停止生成。

Result: 在四个指令调优模型上的GSM8K和AQuA-RAT基准测试中，LEASH平均减少了30-35%的token生成和27%的延迟，相对于CoT准确率下降了10个百分点。

Conclusion: LEASH是模型无关的，无需额外训练或监督，为CoT解码提供了一种简单高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a key technique for enabling complex
reasoning in large language models. However, generating full, fixed-length
rationales is computationally wasteful, inflating both token usage and latency.
We introduce LEASH: Logit-Entropy Adaptive Stopping Heuristic, a training-free
decoding algorithm that adaptively halts rationale generation. LEASH monitors
two intrinsic signals: the slope of token-level entropy and the improvement in
the top-logit margin. It terminates the generation once both signals plateau,
indicating the model has reached a stable reasoning state. Across four
instruction-tuned models on the GSM8K and AQuA-RAT benchmarks, LEASH reduces
average token generation by 30--35% and latency by 27%, while incurring a 10
p.p. accuracy drop relative to CoT. LEASH is model-agnostic and requires no
additional training or supervision, offering a simple and efficient alternative
to CoT decoding.

Abstract: Music editing has emerged as an important and practical area of artificial
intelligence, with applications ranging from video game and film music
production to personalizing existing tracks according to user preferences.
However, existing models face significant limitations, such as being restricted
to editing synthesized music generated by their own models, requiring highly
precise prompts, or necessitating task-specific retraining, thus lacking true

diffusion transformers, we introduce MusRec, the first zero-shot text-to-music
editing model capable of performing diverse editing tasks on real-world music
efficiently and effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing methods in preserving musical content, structural
consistency, and editing fidelity, establishing a strong foundation for
controllable music editing in real-world scenarios.

### [110] [PromptSep: Generative Audio Separation via Multimodal Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04623)
*Yutong Wen,Ke Chen,Prem Seetharaman,Oriol Nieto,Jiaqi Su,Rithesh Kumar,Minje Kim,Paris Smaragdis,Zeyu Jin,Justin Salamon*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: PromptSep is a general-purpose sound separation framework using diffusion models that supports both audio extraction/removal and multimodal queries (text + vocal imitation).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LASS systems have limitations: (1) only support separation, not removal operations; (2) text-only queries are often unintuitive for sound specification.

Method: Uses conditional diffusion model with data simulation, supports multimodal conditioning (text + vocal imitation) via Sketch2Sound augmentation.

Result: Achieves SOTA in sound removal and vocal-imitation-guided separation, maintains competitive performance in text-based separation across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: PromptSepextends LASS into a more practical framework supporting diverse operations and intuitive multimodal queries with superior performance.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in language-queried audio source separation (LASS) have
shown that generative models can achieve higher separation audio quality than
traditional masking-based approaches. However, two key limitations restrict
their practical use: (1) users often require operations beyond separation, such
as sound removal; and (2) relying solely on text prompts can be unintuitive for
specifying sound sources. In this paper, we propose PromptSep to extend LASS
into a broader framework for general-purpose sound separation. PromptSep
leverages a conditional diffusion model enhanced with elaborated data
simulation to enable both audio extraction and sound removal. To move beyond
text-only queries, we incorporate vocal imitation as an additional and more
intuitive conditioning modality for our model, by incorporating Sketch2Sound as
a data augmentation strategy. Both objective and subjective evaluations on
multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PromptSep achieves state-of-the-art
performance in sound removal and vocal-imitation-guided source separation,
while maintaining competitive results on language-queried source separation.

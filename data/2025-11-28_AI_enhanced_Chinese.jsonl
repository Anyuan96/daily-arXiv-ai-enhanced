In this paper, we introduce a simple, lightweight, and broadly applicable method with a focus on isolating neurons that encode specific skills. Building upon prior work that identified \"skill neurons\" via soft prompt training on classification tasks, our approach extends the analysis to complex scenarios involving multiple skills. We correlate neuron activations with auxiliary metrics -- such as external labels and the model's own confidence score -- thereby uncovering interpretable and task-specific behaviors without the need for manual token aggregation. We empirically validate our method on tasks spanning open-ended text generation and natural language inference, demonstrating its ability to detect neurons that not only drive known skills but also reveal previously unidentified shortcuts in arithmetic reasoning on BigBench.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u4e14\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc6\u522bLLM\u4e2d\u7f16\u7801\u7279\u5b9a\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bc6\u522b'\u6280\u80fd\u795e\u7ecf\u5143'\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7b49\u8f85\u52a9\u6307\u6807\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86BigBench\u7b97\u672f\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5148\u524d\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u6377\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u4ecd\u7136\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u7f16\u7801\u7279\u5b9a\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bc6\u522b\u6280\u80fd\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5206\u6790\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u6280\u80fd\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7b49\u8f85\u52a9\u6307\u6807\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u8bb0\u805a\u5408\u5373\u53ef\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5df2\u77e5\u6280\u80fd\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728BigBench\u7b97\u672f\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u6377\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63ed\u793aLLM\u4e2d\u6280\u80fd\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

In addition, learnable meta-tokens trained with masked loss can recover part of the speedup by inducing quality-aware latent structure.

We show that small orchestrators managing other models and a variety of tools can both push the upper bound of intelligence and improve efficiency in solving difficult agentic tasks. We introduce ToolOrchestra, a method for training small orchestrators that coordinate intelligent tools. ToolOrchestra explicitly uses reinforcement learning with outcome-, efficiency-, and user-preference-aware rewards. Using ToolOrchestra, we produce Orchestrator, an 8B model that achieves higher accuracy at lower cost than previous tool-use agents while aligning with user preferences on which tools are to be used for a given query. On HLE, Orchestrator achieves a score of 37.1%, outperforming GPT-5 (35.1%) while being 2.5x more efficient. On tau2-Bench and FRAMES, Orchestrator surpasses GPT-5 by a wide margin while using only about 30% of the cost. Extensive analysis shows that Orchestrator achieves the best trade-off between performance and cost under multiple metrics, and generalizes robustly to unseen tools.

Existing research is mixed regarding whether training on easier or harder data leads to better results, and whether those gains come on easier or harder test data. We address this question by conducting a systematic evaluation of LLMs' generalization across models, datasets, and fine-grained groups of example difficulty. We rank examples in six datasets using the outputs of thousands of different LLMs and Item Response Theory (IRT), a well-established difficulty metric in educational testing. Unlike prior work, our difficulty ratings are therefore determined solely by the abilities of many different LLMs, excluding human opinions of difficulty. With a more objective, larger-scale, and finer-grained analysis, we show that cross-difficulty generalization is often limited; training on either easy or hard data cannot achieve consistent improvements across the full range of difficulties. These results show the importance of having a range of difficulties in both training and evaluation data for LLMs, and that taking shortcuts with respect to difficulty is risky.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u5343\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u548c\u9879\u76ee\u53cd\u5e94\u7406\u8bba\uff08IRT\uff09\u5bf9\u516d\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u96be\u5ea6\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86LLM\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u96be\u5ea6\u4ea4\u53c9\u6cdb\u5316\u901a\u5e38\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u8bba\u96be\u6613\u90fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u6240\u6709\u96be\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u6574\u7406\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96be\u6613\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u6b67\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u5343\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u548c\u9879\u76ee\u53cd\u5e94\u7406\u8bba\uff08IRT\uff09\u5bf9\u516d\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u96be\u5ea6\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u6392\u9664\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u4e3b\u89c2\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u5ba2\u89c2\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u96be\u5ea6\u4ea4\u53c9\u6cdb\u5316\u901a\u5e38\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u6216\u56f0\u96be\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u90fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u6240\u6709\u96be\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728LLM\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u96be\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u96be\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u8d70\u6377\u5f84\u5b58\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

G$^2$VLM natively leverages learned 3D visual geometry features to directly predict 3D attributes and enhance spatial reasoning tasks via in-context learning and interleaved reasoning. Our unified design is highly scalable for spatial understanding: it trains on abundant multi-view image and video data, while simultaneously leveraging the benefits of 3D visual priors that are typically only derived from hard-to-collect annotations. Experimental results demonstrate G$^2$VLM is proficient in both tasks, achieving comparable results to state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D reconstruction models and achieving better or competitive results across spatial understanding and reasoning tasks.

A key limitation is that the standard denoising MSE objective provides no direct supervision on temporal consistency, allowing models to achieve low loss while still generating poor motion. We propose MoGAN, a motion-centric post-training framework that improves motion realism without reward models or human preference data. Built atop a 3-step distilled video diffusion model, we train a DiT-based optical-flow discriminator to differentiate real from generated motion, combined with a distribution-matching regularizer to preserve visual fidelity. With experiments on Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B, MoGAN substantially improves motion quality across benchmarks. On VBench, MoGAN boosts motion score by +7.3% over the 50-step teacher and +13.3% over the 3-step DMD model. On VideoJAM-Bench, MoGAN improves motion score by +7.4% over the teacher and +8.8% over DMD, while maintaining comparable or even better aesthetic and image-quality scores. A human study further confirms that MoGAN is preferred for motion quality (52% vs. 38% for the teacher; 56% vs. 29% for DMD). Overall, MoGAN delivers significantly more realistic motion without sacrificing visual fidelity or efficiency, offering a practical path toward fast, high-quality video generation.

To address this, we propose a self-prompting, point-supervised framework that adapts SAM to RSIs using only sparse point annotations. Our method employs a Refine-Requery-Reinforce loop, where coarse pseudo-masks are generated from initial points (Refine), improved with self-constructed box prompts (Requery), and embeddings are aligned across iterations to reduce confirmation bias (Reinforce). Without relying on full-mask supervision, our approach progressively enhances SAM's segmentation quality and domain robustness through self-guided prompt adaptation . We evaluate our proposed method on three RSI benchmark datasets, including WHU, HRSID, and NWPU VHR-10, showing that our method consistently surpasses pretrained SAM and recent point-supervised segmentation methods.

First, we develop a novel acquisition function that employs an adversarial strategy to identify a compact set of informative exemplars for labeling. This selection process balances representativeness, diversity, and uncertainty. Second, we introduce bidirectional and stable GCN architectures.

It natively supports interleaved contexts of up to 256K tokens, seamlessly integrating text, images, and video. The model family includes both dense (2B/4B/8B/32B) and mixture-of-experts (30B-A3B/235B-A22B) variants to accommodate diverse latency-quality trade-offs. Qwen3-VL delivers three core pillars: (i) markedly stronger pure-text understanding, surpassing comparable text-only backbones in several cases; (ii) robust long-context comprehension with a native 256K-token window for both text and interleaved multimodal inputs, enabling faithful retention, retrieval, and cross-referencing across long documents and videos; and (iii) advanced multimodal reasoning across single-image, multi-image, and video tasks, demonstrating leading performance on comprehensive evaluations such as MMMU and visual-math benchmarks (e.g., MathVista and MathVision). Architecturally, we introduce three key upgrades: (i) an enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for stronger spatial-temporal modeling across images and video; (ii) DeepStack integration, which effectively leverages multi-level ViT features to tighten vision-language alignment; and (iii) text-based time alignment for video, evolving from T-RoPE to explicit textual timestamp alignment for more precise temporal grounding. Under comparable token budgets and latency constraints, Qwen3-VL achieves superior performance in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures.

While existing solutions focus on error detection, they rarely provide efficient correction mechanisms, especially for resource-constrained devices. We present a novel system enabling users to correct AI misclassifications through few-shot learning, requiring minimal computational resources and storage. Our approach combines server-side foundation model training with on-device prototype-based classification, enabling efficient error correction through prototype updates rather than model retraining. The system consists of two key components: (1) a server-side pipeline that leverages knowledge distillation to transfer robust feature representations from foundation models to device-compatible architectures, and (2) a device-side mechanism that enables ultra-efficient error correction through prototype adaptation. We demonstrate our system's effectiveness on both image classification and object detection tasks, achieving over 50% error correction in one-shot scenarios on Food-101 and Flowers-102 datasets while maintaining minimal forgetting (less than 0.02%) and negligible computational overhead.

Long-term AQA, as in figure skating or rhythmic gymnastics, is especially challenging since it requires modeling extended temporal dynamics while remaining robust to contextual confounders. Existing approaches either depend on costly annotations or rely on unidirectional temporal modeling, making them vulnerable to spurious correlations and unstable long-term representations. To this end, we propose CaFlow, a unified framework that integrates counterfactual de-confounding with bidirectional time-conditioned flow. The Causal Counterfactual Regularization (CCR) module disentangles causal and confounding features in a self-supervised manner and enforces causal robustness through counterfactual interventions, while the BiT-Flow module models forward and backward dynamics with a cycle-consistency constraint to produce smoother and more coherent representations. Extensive experiments on multiple long-term AQA benchmarks demonstrate that CaFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance.

However, their ability to follow diverse, fine-grained evaluation criteria remains underexplored. We develop Multi-Crit, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal judges on their capacity to follow pluralistic criteria and produce reliable criterion-level judgments. Covering both open-ended generation and verifiable reasoning tasks, Multi-Crit is built through a rigorous data curation pipeline that gathers challenging response pairs with multi-criterion human annotations. It further introduces three novel metrics for systematically assessing pluralistic adherence, criterion-switching flexibility, and the ability to recognize criterion-level preference conflicts. Comprehensive analysis of 25 LMMs reveals that 1) proprietary models still struggle to maintain consistent adherence to pluralistic criteria--especially in open-ended evaluation; 2) open-source models lag further behind in flexibly following diverse criteria; and 3) critic fine-tuning with holistic judgment signals enhances visual grounding but fails to generalize to pluralistic criterion-level judgment. Additional analyses on reasoning fine-tuning, test-time scaling, and boundary consistency between open-source and proprietary models further probe the limits of current multimodal judges. As a pioneering study, Multi-Crit lays the foundation for building reliable and steerable multimodal AI evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Multi-Crit\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9075\u5faa\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u9760\u6807\u51c6\u7ea7\u522b\u5224\u65ad\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u6db5\u76d6\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6d41\u7a0b\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u4e2a\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u9075\u5faa\u6027\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5207\u6362\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u6807\u51c6\u7ea7\u522b\u504f\u597d\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08LMMs\uff09\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u7528\u4f5c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9075\u5faa\u591a\u6837\u5316\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9075\u5faa\u591a\u5143\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u9760\u5224\u65ad\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6d41\u7a0b\u6784\u5efaMulti-Crit\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u5177\u6709\u591a\u6807\u51c6\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\u5bf9\u3002\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u6db5\u76d6\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u591a\u5143\u9075\u5faa\u6027\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5207\u6362\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u6807\u51c6\u7ea7\u522b\u504f\u597d\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5bf925\u4e2aLMMs\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff1a1\uff09\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u591a\u5143\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9075\u5faa\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff1b2\uff09\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7075\u6d3b\u9075\u5faa\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u843d\u540e\uff1b3\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u6574\u4f53\u5224\u65ad\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u6279\u8bc4\u5fae\u8c03\u867d\u7136\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u80fd\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u591a\u5143\u6807\u51c6\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u3002", "conclusion": "Multi-Crit\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u53ef\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001AI\u8bc4\u4f30\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u9075\u5faa\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

However, existing adversarial attack methods require costly end-to-end training and often generate noticeable perturbation patches. To address these limitations, we propose ADVLA, a framework that directly applies adversarial perturbations on features projected from the visual encoder into the textual feature space. ADVLA efficiently disrupts downstream action predictions under low-amplitude constraints, and attention guidance allows the perturbations to be both focused and sparse. We introduce three strategies that enhance sensitivity, enforce sparsity, and concentrate perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that under an $L_{\\infty}=4/255$ constraint, ADVLA combined with Top-K masking modifies less than 10% of the patches while achieving an attack success rate of nearly 100%. The perturbations are concentrated on critical regions, remain almost imperceptible in the overall image, and a single-step iteration takes only about 0.06 seconds, significantly outperforming conventional patch-based attacks. In summary, ADVLA effectively weakens downstream action predictions of VLA models under low-amplitude and locally sparse conditions, avoiding the high training costs and conspicuous perturbations of traditional patch attacks, and demonstrates unique effectiveness and practical value for attacking VLA feature spaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "ADVLA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5230\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u7834\u574fVLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u5e45\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5173\u6ce8\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u8865\u4e01\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e14\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u660e\u663e\u6270\u52a8\u8865\u4e01\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9690\u853d\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ADVLA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3a\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3001\u5f3a\u5236\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u96c6\u4e2d\u6270\u52a8\u3002\u7ed3\u5408Top-K\u63a9\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c40\u90e8\u7a00\u758f\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728L\u221e=4/255\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0cADVLA+Top-K\u63a9\u7801\u4fee\u6539\u5c11\u4e8e10%\u7684\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fd1100%\u3002\u6270\u52a8\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u53ef\u5bdf\u89c9\uff0c\u5355\u6b65\u8fed\u4ee3\u4ec5\u97000.06\u79d2\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u8865\u4e01\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "ADVLA\u5728\u4f4e\u5e45\u5ea6\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7a00\u758f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u524a\u5f31VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u548c\u660e\u663e\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5bf9\u653b\u51fbVLA\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

To address this difficulty, the proposed research will develop a hybrid deep learning model which integrates U-Net based segmentation and a hybrid DenseNet-VGG classification network with multihead attention and spatial-channel attention capabilities. The segmentation model will precisely demarcate the tumors in a 3D volume of MRI data guided by spatial and contextual information. The classification network which combines a branch of both DenseNet and VGG, will incorporate the demarcated tumor on which features with attention mechanisms would be focused on clinically relevant features. High-dimensional 3D MRI data could successfully be utilized in the model through preprocessing steps which are normalization, resampling, and data augmentation. Through a variety of measures the framework is evaluated: measures of performance in segmentation are Dice coefficient and Mean Intersection over Union (IoU) and measures of performance in classification are accuracy precision, recall, and F1-score. The hybrid framework that has been proposed has demonstrated through physical testing that it has the capability of obtaining a Dice coefficient of 98% in tumor segmentation, and 99% on classification accuracy, outperforming traditional CNN models and attention-free methods. Utilizing multi-head attention mechanisms enhances notions of priority in aspects of the tumor that are clinically significant, and enhances interpretability and accuracy.

This paper is the first to systematically investigate this seemingly implausible question. Towards this end, we propose a contrastive learning framework to train CamFormer, a dedicated encoder that projects camera pose trajectories into a joint embedding space, aligning them with natural language. We find that, contrary to its apparent simplicity, the camera trajectory is a remarkably informative signal to uncover video content. In other words, \"how you move\" can indeed reveal \"what you are doing\" (egocentric) or \"observing\" (exocentric). We demonstrate the versatility of our learned CamFormer embeddings on a diverse suite of downstream tasks, ranging from cross-modal alignment to classification and temporal analysis. Importantly, our representations are robust across diverse camera pose estimation methods, including both high-fidelity multi-sensored and standard RGB-only estimators.

We introduce Canvas-to-Image, a unified framework that consolidates these heterogeneous controls into a single canvas interface, enabling users to generate images that faithfully reflect their intent. Our key idea is to encode diverse control signals into a single composite canvas image that the model can directly interpret for integrated visual-spatial reasoning. We further curate a suite of multi-task datasets and propose a Multi-Task Canvas Training strategy that optimizes the diffusion model to jointly understand and integrate heterogeneous controls into text-to-image generation within a unified learning paradigm. This joint training enables Canvas-to-Image to reason across multiple control modalities rather than relying on task-specific heuristics, and it generalizes well to multi-control scenarios during inference. Extensive experiments show that Canvas-to-Image significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity preservation and control adherence across challenging benchmarks, including multi-person composition, pose-controlled composition, layout-constrained generation, and multi-control generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "", "motivation": "", "method": "", "result": "", "conclusion": ""}}

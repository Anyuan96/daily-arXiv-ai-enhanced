### [1] [Enhancing Underwater Object Detection through Spatio-Temporal Analysis and Spatial Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25797)
*Sai Likhith Karri,Ansh Saxena*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了时空建模和空间注意力机制在深度学习水下目标检测中的有效性，比较了标准YOLOv5、T-YOLOv5和T-YOLOv5+CBAM三种模型的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在提升水下目标检测在动态海洋环境中的准确性，特别是针对突然运动、部分遮挡和渐进运动等具有挑战性的条件

Method: 分两个阶段进行：第一阶段评估T-YOLOv5与标准YOLOv5的性能；第二阶段在T-YOLOv5基础上集成卷积块注意力模块(CBAM)

Result: T-YOLOv5(mAP@50-95=0.813)和T-YOLOv5+CBAM(0.811)均显著优于标准YOLOv5(0.563)，在复杂场景下表现更优，但CBAM在简单场景下略有精度损失

Conclusion: 时空建模显著提升检测可靠性，而CBAM进一步改善了挑战性场景的性能，体现了时空建模和注意力机制在水下目标检测中的重要价值

Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of spatio-temporal modeling and the
integration of spatial attention mechanisms in deep learning models for
underwater object detection. Specifically, in the first phase, the performance
of temporal-enhanced YOLOv5 variant T-YOLOv5 is evaluated, in comparison with
the standard YOLOv5. For the second phase, an augmented version of T-YOLOv5 is
developed, through the addition of a Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM). By examining the effectiveness of the already pre-existing YOLOv5 and
T-YOLOv5 models and of the newly developed T-YOLOv5 with CBAM. With CBAM, the
research highlights how temporal modeling improves detection accuracy in
dynamic marine environments, particularly under conditions of sudden movements,
partial occlusions, and gradual motion. The testing results showed that YOLOv5
achieved a mAP@50-95 of 0.563, while T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
outperformed with mAP@50-95 scores of 0.813 and 0.811, respectively,
highlighting their superior accuracy and generalization in detecting complex
objects. The findings demonstrate that T-YOLOv5 significantly enhances
detection reliability compared to the standard model, while T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
further improves performance in challenging scenarios, although there is a loss
of accuracy when it comes to simpler scenarios.

### [2] [MIRO: MultI-Reward cOnditioned pretraining improves T2I quality and efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25897)
*Nicolas Dufour,Lucas Degeorge,Arijit Ghosh,Vicky Kalogeiton,David Picard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIRO方法通过在训练过程中直接集成多奖励模型条件化，解决现有后处理奖励过滤方法造成的多样性和语义保真度损失问题，实现了更高效和高质量的图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本到图像生成模型在大规模未筛选数据集上训练，难以准确对齐用户偏好。现有奖励模型采用后处理选择机制，但这种方式会丢弃信息、损害多样性、语义保真度和训练效率。

Method: 提出MIRO方法，在训练过程中直接条件化模型于多个奖励模型，使模型直接学习用户偏好，而非依赖后处理选择。

Result: 实验表明MIRO不仅大幅提升生成图像视觉质量，还显著加速训练过程，在GenEval组合基准和用户偏好评分上达到state-of-the-art性能。

Conclusion: 通过训练时多奖励条件化可直接有效对齐用户偏好，相比后处理方法在质量、多样性和效率方面均有显著优势。

Abstract: Current text-to-image generative models are trained on large uncurated
datasets to enable diverse generation capabilities. However, this does not
align well with user preferences. Recently, reward models have been
specifically designed to perform post-hoc selection of generated images and
align them to a reward, typically user preference. This discarding of
informative data together with the optimizing for a single reward tend to harm
diversity, semantic fidelity and efficiency. Instead of this post-processing,
we propose to condition the model on multiple reward models during training to
let the model learn user preferences directly. We show that this not only
dramatically improves the visual quality of the generated images but it also
significantly speeds up the training. Our proposed method, called MIRO,
achieves state-of-the-art performances on the GenEval compositional benchmark
and user-preference scores (PickAScore, ImageReward, HPSv2).

### [3] [BikeScenes: Online LiDAR Semantic Segmentation for Bicycles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25901)
*Denniz Goren,Holger Caesar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种针对自行车的3D LiDAR分割方法，并创建了BikeScenes-lidarseg数据集来弥合汽车与自行车领域的差距。结果表明，在领域特定数据集上微调能显著提升分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动自行车普及带来的自行车安全问题突出，需要将汽车感知技术适配到自行车领域，改善骑行者安全。

Method: 使用多传感器'SenseBike'研究平台开发自行车专用3D LiDAR分割方法，并创建包含3021个连续LiDAR扫描的BikeScenes数据集进行微调。

Result: 在BikeScenes数据集上微调后，模型mIoU达到63.6%，显著优于仅使用SemanticKITTI预训练的13.8%结果。

Conclusion: 领域特定训练对自行车LiDAR分割至关重要，BikeScenes数据集为自行车中心感知研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: The vulnerability of cyclists, exacerbated by the rising popularity of faster
e-bikes, motivates adapting automotive perception technologies for bicycle
safety. We use our multi-sensor 'SenseBike' research platform to develop and
evaluate a 3D LiDAR segmentation approach tailored to bicycles. To bridge the
automotive-to-bicycle domain gap, we introduce the novel BikeScenes-lidarseg
Dataset, comprising 3021 consecutive LiDAR scans around the university campus
of the TU Delft, semantically annotated for 29 dynamic and static classes. By
evaluating model performance, we demonstrate that fine-tuning on our BikeScenes
dataset achieves a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 63.6%, significantly
outperforming the 13.8% obtained with SemanticKITTI pre-training alone. This
result underscores the necessity and effectiveness of domain-specific training.
We highlight key challenges specific to bicycle-mounted, hardware-constrained
perception systems and contribute the BikeScenes dataset as a resource for
advancing research in cyclist-centric LiDAR segmentation.

### [4] [Generative Image Restoration and Super-Resolution using Physics-Informed Synthetic Data for Scanning Tunneling Microscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25921)
*Nikola L. Kolev,Tommaso Rodani,Neil J. Curson,Taylor J. Z. Stock,Alberto Cazzaniga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种机器学习方法，通过图像修复和超分辨率技术解决扫描隧道显微镜（STM）中的尖端退化和数据采集速度慢的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扫描隧道显微镜（STM）在原子分辨率成像和原子操纵方面具有强大能力，但其应用常受限于尖端退化和缓慢的串行数据采集。此外，制造过程中尖端常承受高电压，可能导致其形状改变，需要进行尖端调节。

Method: 采用物理信息驱动的合成数据生成流程，仅使用36张原始实验图像（Si(001):H）训练了多种先进的流匹配和扩散模型。通过CLIP最大均值差异（CMMD）评分和结构相似性等指标进行定量评估。

Result: 模型能够有效修复图像，并通过从稀疏采样数据中准确重建图像，实现图像采集时间减少2到4倍。该框架有望显著提高STM实验吞吐量。

Conclusion: 该机器学习框架为减少尖端调节频率和提升现有高速STM系统的帧率提供了有效途径，具有显著提高STM实验效率的潜力。

Abstract: Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) enables atomic-resolution imaging and
atom manipulation, but its utility is often limited by tip degradation and slow
serial data acquisition. Fabrication adds another layer of complexity since the
tip is often subjected to large voltages, which may alter the shape of its
apex, requiring it to be conditioned. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML)
approach for image repair and super-resolution to alleviate both challenges.
Using a dataset of only 36 pristine experimental images of Si(001):H, we
demonstrate that a physics-informed synthetic data generation pipeline can be
used to train several state-of-the-art flow-matching and diffusion models.
Quantitative evaluation with metrics such as the CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(CMMD) score and structural similarity demonstrates that our models are able to
effectively restore images and offer a two- to fourfold reduction in image
acquisition time by accurately reconstructing images from sparsely sampled
data. Our framework has the potential to significantly increase STM
experimental throughput by offering a route to reducing the frequency of
tip-conditioning procedures and to enhancing frame rates in existing high-speed
STM systems.

### [5] [SplitFlow: Flow Decomposition for Inversion-Free Text-to-Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25970)
*Sung-Hoon Yoon,Minghan Li,Gaspard Beaudouin,Congcong Wen,Muhammad Rafay Azhar,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于整流流模型的图像编辑框架，通过逆过程无需求的流分解与聚合方法，解决现有编辑方法中的反转不准确和梯度纠缠问题，提升语义保真度和属性解缠能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 整流流模型虽在图像生成中表现优异，但在图像编辑任务中存在反转过程不准确和梯度纠缠问题，导致编辑输出无法忠实反映目标语义。现有基于ODE的无反转方法编辑质量仍不理想。

Method: 提出流分解与聚合框架：将目标提示语义分解为多个子提示，为每个子提示计算独立流，通过投影和软聚合机制自适应加权子目标速度场，抑制语义冗余并强调不同方向，形成统一编辑轨迹。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在零样本编辑任务中优于现有方法，在语义保真度和属性解缠方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 通过流分解与聚合框架有效解决了整流流模型在图像编辑中的局限性，实现了既保持多样性又确保语义一致性的高质量图像编辑。

Abstract: Rectified flow models have become a de facto standard in image generation due
to their stable sampling trajectories and high-fidelity outputs. Despite their
strong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing
tasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the
latent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in
outputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have
attempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based
approaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal
editing quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation
framework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these
limitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into
multiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them
to form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that
decomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,
generating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance
toward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and
soft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution
in multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target
velocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct
directions, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final
edited output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and
attribute disentanglement. The code is available at

### [6] [Brain-IT: Image Reconstruction from fMRI via Brain-Interaction Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25976)
*Roman Beliy,Amit Zalcher,Jonathan Kogman,Navve Wasserman,Michal Irani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Brain-IT是一种从fMRI脑记录重建人眼所见图像的脑启发放射学方法，通过Brain Interaction Transformer实现功能相似脑体素簇之间的有效交互，相比现有方法在忠实度和效率上都有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的fMRI图像重建方法往往缺乏对实际所见图像的忠实性，需要一种更有效的方法来改善重建图像的质量和准确性。

Method: 提出Brain-IT方法，使用Brain Interaction Transformer实现脑体素功能簇之间的交互，预测高层语义特征和低层结构特征来指导图像重建，所有模型组件在所有簇和受试者之间共享。

Result: 方法在fMRI图像重建方面超越了当前最先进方法，在视觉感受和客观指标上都有更好表现，仅用1小时fMRI数据就能达到与现有方法使用40小时数据相当的效果。

Conclusion: Brain-IT通过脑启发的功能性簇交互和互补的特征预测机制，实现了更忠实高效的fMRI图像重建，为脑机接口研究提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Reconstructing images seen by people from their fMRI brain recordings
provides a non-invasive window into the human brain. Despite recent progress
enabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the
actual seen images. We present "Brain-IT", a brain-inspired approach that
addresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT),
allowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar
brain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as
building blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All
model components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient
training with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT
predicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level
semantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic
content of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to
initialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image.
BIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to
localized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image
reconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and
surpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective
metrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve
results comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.

*Valentin Boussot,Cédric Hémon,Jean-Claude Nunes,Jean-Louis Dillenseger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文针对TrackRAD2025挑战赛，在数据稀缺约束下开发了基于SAM 2.1快速分割的实时肿瘤追踪方法，在隐藏测试集上获得0.8794的Dice分数，排名第6。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MRI引导放疗中实时肿瘤追踪的挑战，特别是在数据稀缺条件下满足1秒处理时间约束。

Method: 采用SAM 2.1预训练模型，使用第一标注切片进行提示，在TrackRAD2025小数据集上微调，采用1024x1024补丁、数据增强和平衡损失函数。

Result: 在TrackRAD2025隐藏测试集上获得0.8794 Dice分数，排名第6，证明基础模型在实时MRI肿瘤追踪中的有效性。

Conclusion: 基础模型(SAM 2.1)具有在实时MRI引导放疗中进行准确肿瘤追踪的强大潜力。

Abstract: In this work, we address the TrackRAD2025 challenge of real-time tumor
tracking in cine-MRI sequences of the thoracic and abdominal regions under
strong data scarcity constraints. Two complementary strategies were explored:
(i) unsupervised registration with the IMPACT similarity metric and (ii)
foundation model-based segmentation leveraging SAM 2.1 and its recent variants
through prompt-based interaction. Due to the one-second runtime constraint, the
SAM-based method was ultimately selected. The final configuration used SAM2.1
b+ with mask-based prompts from the first annotated slice, fine-tuned solely on
the small labeled subset from TrackRAD2025. Training was configured to minimize
overfitting, using 1024x1024 patches (batch size 1), standard augmentations,
and a balanced Dice + IoU loss. A low uniform learning rate (0.0001) was
applied to all modules (prompt encoder, decoder, Hiera backbone) to preserve
generalization while adapting to annotator-specific styles. Training lasted 300
epochs (~12h on RTX A6000, 48GB). The same inference strategy was consistently
applied across all anatomical sites and MRI field strengths. Test-time
augmentation was considered but ultimately discarded due to negligible
performance gains. The final model was selected based on the highest Dice
Similarity Coefficient achieved on the validation set after fine-tuning. On the
hidden test set, the model reached a Dice score of 0.8794, ranking 6th overall
in the TrackRAD2025 challenge. These results highlight the strong potential of
foundation models for accurate and real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided
radiotherapy.

### [8] [Larger Hausdorff Dimension in Scanning Pattern Facilitates Mamba-Based Methods in Low-Light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26001)
*Xinhua Wang,Caibo Feng,Xiangjun Fu,Chunxiao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文提出通过Hilbert选择性扫描机制增强Mamba框架的Hausdorff维度，显著提升低光图像增强任务的性能表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决Mamba框架在特征空间扫描时的信息不一致问题，同时改善空间局部性以捕捉更精细的局部交互

Method: 采用创新的Hilbert选择性扫描机制，通过提升扫描模式的Hausdorff维度来更有效地探索特征空间

Result: 在公开基准测试中显著提高了Mamba基低光图像增强方法的定量指标和定性视觉保真度，同时减少了计算资源消耗和推理时间

Conclusion: 该策略不仅推动了低光图像增强的技术发展，也在其他Mamba基技术应用中具有广阔前景

Abstract: We propose an innovative enhancement to the Mamba framework by increasing the
Hausdorff dimension of its scanning pattern through a novel Hilbert Selective
Scan mechanism. This mechanism explores the feature space more effectively,
capturing intricate fine-scale details and improving overall coverage. As a
result, it mitigates information inconsistencies while refining spatial
locality to better capture subtle local interactions without sacrificing the
model's ability to handle long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on
publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves both the quantitative metrics and qualitative visual fidelity of
existing Mamba-based low-light image enhancement methods, all while reducing
computational resource consumption and shortening inference time. We believe
that this refined strategy not only advances the state-of-the-art in low-light
image enhancement but also holds promise for broader applications in fields
that leverage Mamba-based techniques.

*Rishika Bhagwatkar,Syrielle Montariol,Angelika Romanou,Beatriz Borges,Irina Rish,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAVE是第一个真实世界的视觉异常检测基准，支持异常描述、解释和论证三个开放任务，为VLMs在异常检测和常识推理方面的研究提供了有价值的资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算机视觉领域的异常检测仅限于工业缺陷或合成异常，无法捕捉现实世界异常的丰富性和不可预测性。

Method: 引入CAVE基准，基于认知科学研究提供细粒度注释，包括视觉定位、异常分类以及基于视觉表现、复杂性、严重性和常见性的评估。

Result: 实验表明，即使采用先进的提示策略，最先进的VLMs在视觉异常感知和常识推理方面仍存在困难。

Conclusion: CAVE作为一个现实且基于认知科学的基准，有助于推动VLMs在异常检测和常识推理方面的研究进展。

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify, reason about, and explain anomalies in their
environment. In computer vision, this long-standing challenge remains limited
to industrial defects or unrealistic, synthetically generated anomalies,
failing to capture the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies.
In this work, we introduce CAVE, the first benchmark of real-world visual
anomalies. CAVE supports three open-ended tasks: anomaly description,
explanation, and justification; with fine-grained annotations for visual
grounding and categorizing anomalies based on their visual manifestations,
their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration
from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies,
providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art
VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even
with advanced prompting strategies. By offering a realistic and cognitively
grounded benchmark, CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research
in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.

TL;DR: 开发基于CNN的轻量深度学习模型，用于预测气候变化下的沿海洪水灾害，在多个地区验证并显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理模拟方法计算成本高，难以满足城市尺度规划需求，需要高效精确的洪水预测工具来应对气候变化威胁。

Method: 利用基于视觉的低资源深度学习框架，构建轻量CNN模型，预测不同海平面上升情景下的沿海洪水，并在阿布扎比和旧金山数据集上验证泛化能力。

Result: 模型显著优于现有方法，预测洪水深度图的平均绝对误差降低近20%。

Conclusion: 该模型可作为可扩展的实用工具支持沿海洪水管理，帮助决策者制定有效的气候变化应对策略。

Abstract: Climate change and sea-level rise (SLR) pose escalating threats to coastal
cities, intensifying the need for efficient and accurate methods to predict
potential flood hazards. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic simulators,
although precise, are computationally expensive and impractical for city-scale
coastal planning applications. Deep Learning (DL) techniques offer promising
alternatives, however, they are often constrained by challenges such as data
scarcity and high-dimensional output requirements. Leveraging a recently
proposed vision-based, low-resource DL framework, we develop a novel,
lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model designed to predict
coastal flooding under variable SLR projections and shoreline adaptation
scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of the model to generalize
across diverse geographical contexts by utilizing datasets from two distinct
regions: Abu Dhabi and San Francisco. Our findings demonstrate that the
proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing the
mean absolute error (MAE) in predicted flood depth maps on average by nearly
20%. These results highlight the potential of our approach to serve as a
scalable and practical tool for coastal flood management, empowering
decision-makers to develop effective mitigation strategies in response to the
growing impacts of climate change. Project Page: https://caspiannet.github.io/

Conclusion: 通过增强视觉编码器的时序结构，有效解决了视频大语言模型在视频理解方面的关键瓶颈。项目页面和代码已开源。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
understanding complex temporal dynamics in videos remains a major challenge.
Our experiments show that current Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM)
architectures have critical limitations in temporal understanding, struggling
with tasks that require detailed comprehension of action sequences and temporal
progression. In this work, we propose a Video-LLM architecture that introduces
stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder. This
design incorporates a temporal attention in vision encoder, enabling the model
to better capture the progression of actions and the relationships between
frames before passing visual tokens to the LLM. Our results show that this
approach significantly improves temporal reasoning and outperforms existing
models in video question answering tasks, specifically in action recognition.
We improve on benchmarks including VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME by up to
+5.5%. By enhancing the vision encoder with temporal structure, we address a
critical gap in video understanding for Video-LLMs. Project page and code are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlexICL是一种新颖灵活的上下文学习框架，用于超声图像中的骨骼区域分割，通过在视频内分割设置中利用少量标注帧实现高效分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿科肘腕骨折常见，但超声图像分割需要专家标注，成本高且耗时。FlexICL旨在解决标注数据稀缺的问题，提升诊断准确性。

Method: 采用视觉上下文学习框架，研究多种图像拼接技术和训练策略，引入新颖的拼接方法，结合多重增强策略，仅需5%标注图像。

Result: 在四个肘腕超声数据集上，FlexICL在1,252次超声扫描中Dice系数比先进模型提升1-27%，表现优于Painter、MAE-VQGAN、U-Net和TransUNet。

Conclusion: FlexICL为标注数据稀缺的医学影像分割提供了高效可扩展的解决方案，具有显著的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Elbow and wrist fractures are the most common fractures in pediatric
populations. Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound
(US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear
as cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can
provide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly
trained users perform exams more confidently. However, pixel-wise expert
annotations for training remain time-consuming and costly. To address this
challenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL)
framework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an
intra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of
frames, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate
various image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL
and introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model
performance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation
strategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist
and elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It
outperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and
conventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice
coefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential
of FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well
suited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.

### [13] [Dynamic VLM-Guided Negative Prompting for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26052)
*Hoyeon Chang,Seungjin Kim,Yoonseok Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种利用视觉语言模型的动态负提示方法，该方法能在去噪过程中自适应生成负提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的负提示方法使用的是固定的负提示，无法根据图像生成的中间状态进行动态调整，这限制了其效果。该方法旨在通过视觉语言模型生成与图像上下文相关的负提示，提升文本-图像对齐质量。

Method: 在特定去噪步骤生成中间图像预测，并查询视觉语言模型来生成与上下文相适应的负提示。

Result: 在不同基准数据集上的评估显示，该方法能平衡负引导强度和文本-图像对齐之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 提出的动态负提示方法优于传统固定负提示方法，尤其在使用视觉语言模型进行负提示调整时，显著提升了文本-图像对齐质量。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dynamic negative prompting in diffusion
models that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to adaptively generate
negative prompts during the denoising process. Unlike traditional Negative
Prompting methods that use fixed negative prompts, our method generates
intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and queries a VLM to
produce contextually appropriate negative prompts. We evaluate our approach on
various benchmark datasets and demonstrate the trade-offs between negative
guidance strength and text-image alignment.

*Xiaosen Wang,Zhijin Ge,Shaokang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种称为PReMA的新型对抗性攻击方法，该方法通过修改输入图像（而不是提示）来操纵多模态扩散模型的输出，从而绕过现有安全机制生成NSFW内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型中文本与图像模态的对齐存在不足，这种错位带来了安全风险，特别是在可能生成不适当内容方面

Method: 提出Prompt-Restricted Multi-modal Attack (PReMA)方法，通过修改输入图像来操纵模型输出，而不改变提示文本本身

Result: 在图像修复和风格转换任务上的综合评估证实了PReMA方法的有效性和攻击威力

Conclusion: PReMA对多模态扩散模型的完整性构成了新型威胁，特别是在使用固定提示的图像编辑应用中

Abstract: Despite the notable advancements and versatility of multi-modal diffusion
models, such as text-to-image models, their susceptibility to adversarial
inputs remains underexplored. Contrary to expectations, our investigations
reveal that the alignment between textual and Image modalities in existing
diffusion models is inadequate. This misalignment presents significant risks,
especially in the generation of inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW)
content. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Prompt-Restricted
Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) to manipulate the generated content by modifying the
input image in conjunction with any specified prompt, without altering the
prompt itself. PReMA is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by
solely creating adversarial images, distinguishing itself from prior methods
that primarily generate adversarial prompts to produce NSFW content.
Consequently, PReMA poses a novel threat to the integrity of multi-modal

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EgoExo-Con基准测试视频-LLMs在多视角时间一致性理解中的表现，发现了现有模型的局限性，并提出了View-GRPO方法进行改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视频-LLMs在捕捉同一事件的不同视角视频中是否能够实现一致的时间理解。

Method: 引入EgoExo-Con基准测试，包含同步的自我中心和他者中心视角视频对，评估时间验证和时序定位任务。提出View-GRPO强化学习框架来增强跨视角一致性。

Result: 发现现有Video-LLMs存在一致性问题，且简单微调会降低性能。View-GRPO相比SFT和GRPO在提升跨视角一致性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 证明了Video-LLMs在多视角一致性理解方面的局限性，提出的View-GRPO方法有效提升了跨视角的一致性表现。

Abstract: Can Video-LLMs achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture
the same event from different viewpoints? To study this, we introduce
EgoExo-Con (Consistency), a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized
egocentric and exocentric video pairs with human-refined queries in natural
language. EgoExo-Con emphasizes two temporal understanding tasks: Temporal
Verification and Temporal Grounding. It evaluates not only correctness but
consistency across viewpoints. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations of
existing Video-LLMs: (1) models often fail to maintain consistency, with
results far worse than their single-view performances. (2) When naively
finetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints, the models show improved
consistency but often underperform those trained on a single view. For
improvements, we propose View-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework
that effectively strengthens view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging
consistent comprehension across viewpoints. Our method demonstrates its
superiority over naive SFT and GRPO, especially for improving cross-view
consistency. All resources will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了OracleAgent系统，首个专门用于甲骨文结构化管理和检索的智能代理系统，解决了甲骨文研究中流程复杂和检索效率低下的问题。通过整合多个分析工具和多模态知识库，在多种任务上超越了主流多模态大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲骨文作为最早的文字系统之一承载着重要文化遗产，但当前研究面临两大挑战：(1)甲骨文解读涉及复杂的串行和并行子任务流程，(2)信息组织和检索效率低下，学者需花费大量时间搜索和管理相关资料。

Method: 开发了OracleAgent代理系统，整合多个基于大语言模型的甲骨文分析工具，构建了包含140万单字拓片图像和8万解读文本的领域特定多模态知识库，通过多模态工具实现灵活的任务编排。

Result: 实验表明OracleAgent在多模态推理和生成任务上表现优异，超越了GPT-4o等主流多模态大模型。案例研究证实能有效协助领域专家，显著降低甲骨文研究的时间成本。

Conclusion: OracleAgent是甲骨文辅助研究和自动化解读系统实际部署的重要一步，为解决甲骨文研究中的核心挑战提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: As one of the earliest writing systems, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) preserves
the cultural and intellectual heritage of ancient civilizations. However,
current OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS
involves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks,
and (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a
critical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for,
compiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we
present OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured
management and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly
integrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models
(LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS,
which is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection,
cleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M
single-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent
leverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in
retrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior
performance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks,
surpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g.,
GPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can
effectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS
research. These results highlight OracleAgent as a significant step toward the
practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation
systems.

*Yuxuan Li,Tao Wang,Xianben Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合优化3D高斯点和相机姿态的统一框架，无需预校准输入，克服了传统方法依赖外部姿态估计工具的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统新视角合成方法依赖COLMAP等外部相机姿态估计工具，导致计算瓶颈和误差传播。为了解决这些问题，需要开发无需预校准的联合优化方法。

Method: 采用交替优化策略：先用固定姿态通过可微分渲染更新3D高斯参数，再用结合几何和光度约束的自定义3D光流算法优化相机姿态。

Result: 在多个数据集上的评估表明，该方法在重建质量上显著优于现有无COLMAP技术，并普遍超越基于COLMAP的基准方法。

Conclusion: 提出的联合优化框架有效解决了传统方法在视角变化大、特征稀疏场景下的投影误差问题，实现了更高精度的场景重建和姿态估计。

Abstract: Traditional novel view synthesis methods heavily rely on external camera pose
estimation tools such as COLMAP, which often introduce computational
bottlenecks and propagate errors. To address these challenges, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses
without requiring pre-calibrated inputs. Our approach iteratively refines 3D
Gaussian parameters and updates camera poses through a novel co-optimization
strategy, ensuring simultaneous improvements in scene reconstruction fidelity
and pose accuracy. The key innovation lies in decoupling the joint optimization
into two interleaved phases: first, updating 3D Gaussian parameters via
differentiable rendering with fixed poses, and second, refining camera poses
using a customized 3D optical flow algorithm that incorporates geometric and
photometric constraints. This formulation progressively reduces projection
errors, particularly in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations
and sparse feature distributions, where traditional methods struggle. Extensive
evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly
outperforms existing COLMAP-free techniques in reconstruction quality, and also
surpasses the standard COLMAP-based baseline in general.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端驾驶基准主要关注常规场景，无法充分测试系统在尾部场景中的潜力，且当前的开环评估指标不能有效评估多模态驾驶性能。

Method: 构建WOD-E2E数据集，包含12小时驾驶数据，专门针对频率低于0.03%的挑战性尾部场景，并设计RFS评估指标基于人类评价偏好进行轨迹匹配评估。

Result: WOD-E2E提供了高级路由信息、自车状态和360度环视摄像头数据，并发布了验证集的人类偏好标签，测试集用于2025年挑战赛。

Conclusion: 通过WOD-E2E数据集和RFS评估指标，旨在推动可泛化、鲁棒且安全的端到端自动驾驶代理研究，以应对复杂现实场景。

Abstract: Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in
the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily
feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of
these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall
short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating
performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021
driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging
long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring
frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the
high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8
surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail
situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback
Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between
predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted
trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have
released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while
the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.
Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into
generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of
handling complex real-world situations.

TL;DR: 本研究提出将基于梯度的注意力信息直接整合到CNN特征中以改进室内RGB-D SLAM性能，实验表明该方法在大规模环境中优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法虽然能够通过梯度识别网络关注的图像区域，但这种注意力信息很少被直接整合到CNN表示中进行语义对象理解，而SLAM等视觉任务可以从这种整合中受益。

Method: 利用网络梯度获取逐层注意力信息，将其与CNN特征表示相结合，用于RGB-D室内SLAM的帧关联任务。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法相比基线方法有更好的性能表现，尤其是在大规模环境中改进更为明显。

Conclusion: 将任务特定的网络注意力信息集成到CNN表示中能够有效提升SLAM系统的性能，证明了注意力机制在视觉任务中的重要价值。

Abstract: Attention models have recently emerged as a powerful approach, demonstrating
significant progress in various fields. Visualization techniques, such as class
activation mapping, provide visual insights into the reasoning of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). Using network gradients, it is possible to identify
regions where the network pays attention during image recognition tasks.
Furthermore, these gradients can be combined with CNN features to localize more
generalizable, task-specific attentive (salient) regions within scenes.
However, explicit use of this gradient-based attention information integrated
directly into CNN representations for semantic object understanding remains
limited. Such integration is particularly beneficial for visual tasks like
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), where CNN representations
enriched with spatially attentive object locations can enhance performance. In
this work, we propose utilizing task-specific network attention for RGB-D
indoor SLAM. Specifically, we integrate layer-wise attention information
derived from network gradients with CNN feature representations to improve
frame association performance. Experimental results indicate improved
performance compared to baseline methods, particularly for large environments.

TL;DR: FullPart是一个结合隐式和显式范式的3D部件生成框架，通过隐式边界框扩散和全分辨率体素网格生成，解决了传统方法在几何细节和小部件质量方面的不足，并在新构建的大规模数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的3D部件生成方法存在两个主要问题：使用隐式向量集表示的部件几何细节不足；使用显式体素表示的方法共享全局体素网格导致小部件占用体素过少而质量下降。

Method: FullPart框架首先通过隐式边界框向量集扩散过程得到边界框布局，然后在每个部件的固定全分辨率体素网格中生成详细部件。采用中心点编码策略解决不同尺寸部件间的信息交换不对齐问题，并构建了PartVerse-XL大规模数据集。

Result: 广泛的实验证明，FullPart在3D部件生成方面取得了最先进的结果，能够合成复杂的几何细节，特别是对小部件的生成质量有明显的提升。

Conclusion: FullPart通过结合隐式和显式方法的优势，解决了3D部件生成中的关键挑战，为该领域的未来发展提供了强有力的技术支撑和数据集资源。

Abstract: Part-based 3D generation holds great potential for various applications.
Previous part generators that represent parts using implicit vector-set tokens
often suffer from insufficient geometric details. Another line of work adopts
an explicit voxel representation but shares a global voxel grid among all
parts; this often causes small parts to occupy too few voxels, leading to
degraded quality. In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that
combines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding
box layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that
implicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little
geometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed
full-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space,
each part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution,
enabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a
center-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when
exchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby
maintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part
data, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to
date with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation. We will
release all code, data, and model to benefit future research in 3D part
generation.

Conclusion: BasicAVSR不仅推进了任意尺度视频超分辨率的技术水平，还将其核心组件扩展到多种框架中，代码已开源。

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution (AVSR) aims to enhance the resolution
of video frames, potentially at various scaling factors, which presents several
challenges regarding spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a strong baseline BasicAVSR
for AVSR by integrating four key components: 1) adaptive multi-scale frequency
priors generated from image Laplacian pyramids, 2) a flow-guided propagation
unit to aggregate spatiotemporal information from adjacent frames, 3) a
second-order motion compensation unit for more accurate spatial alignment of
adjacent frames, and 4) a hyper-upsampling unit to generate scale-aware and
content-independent upsampling kernels. To meet diverse application demands, we
instantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for
strictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a
limited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a
bidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources
are less constrained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
adaptability of our model across these different scenarios. Through extensive
experiments, we show that BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods
in terms of super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference
speed. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in AVSR but also extends
its core components to multiple frameworks for diverse scenarios. The code is

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are essential for training robust Computer-Aided
Diagnosis (CAD) models for breast cancer detection or risk prediction. However,
acquiring such datasets with fine-detailed annotation is both costly and
time-consuming. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are
pre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing
robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces
a novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer
classification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram
images and synthetic radiology reports. Our MV-MLM leverages multi-view
supervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by
employing cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs. This includes
multiple views and the corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. We propose a
novel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and
accuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast
tissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these
patterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated
our method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that
the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three
classification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype
classification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction. Furthermore, the
model exhibits strong data efficiency, outperforming existing fully supervised
or VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need
for actual radiology reports.

Abstract: Modes of transportation vary across countries depending on geographical
location and cultural context. In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the
most common means of local transport. Based on their mode of operation,
rickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto
(pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of
auto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from
accessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite
difficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially
non-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This
paper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect
auto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object
detection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of
1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions. The
results show that our proposed model performs well in real-time auto-rickshaw
detection and offers an mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision and recall values
above 78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both dense and sparse
traffic scenarios. The dataset has been publicly released for further research.

Abstract: Wearable devices such as smart glasses are transforming the way people
interact with their surroundings, enabling users to seek information regarding
entities in their view. Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG)
plays a key role in supporting such questions, yet there is still no
comprehensive benchmark for this task, especially regarding wearables
scenarios. To fill this gap, we present CRAG-MM -- a Comprehensive RAG
benchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. CRAG-MM contains a diverse
set of 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn
conversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to
mimic captures from wearable devices. We carefully constructed the questions to
reflect real-world scenarios and challenges, including five types of
image-quality issues, six question types, varying entity popularity, differing
information dynamism, and different conversation turns. We design three tasks:
single-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn
conversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for
both image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that
straightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM
single- and multi-turn QA, respectively, whereas state-of-the-art industry
solutions have similar quality (32%/45%), underscoring ample room for
improvement. The benchmark has hosted KDD Cup 2025, attracting about 1K
participants and 5K submissions, with winning solutions improving baseline
performance by 28%, highlighting its early impact on advancing the field.

Motivation: 现有的单张图像运动估计方法质量较低，轨迹较粗糖并不准确，需要提升到高分辨率和高质量的运动表示。

Method: 设计了一个新的条件散布模型，利用多尺度特征作为条件，并提出新的训练方法来促进精确构造轨迹、保持形状位置一致性及像素连通性。

Result: 在盲目图像去橡粗和编码曝光摄影应用中，MoTDiff的性能超过了当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能够从单张橡粗图像中生成高质量的高分辨率运动轨迹，为相关计算视觉应用提供了更优秀的运动信息。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of motion information is crucial in diverse computational
imaging and computer vision applications. Researchers have investigated various
methods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including
blur kernels and optical flow. However, existing motion representations are
often of low quality, i.e., coarse-grained and inaccurate. In this paper, we
propose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework
using Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion
representations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality
from a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key
components: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale
feature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new
training method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained
motion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a
motion path, and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory. Our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed MoTDiff can outperform state-of-the-art methods
in both blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography applications.

Motivation: 解决视觉数据集中普遍存在但难以系统识别的偏差问题，避免需要昂贵的人工细粒度属性标注。

Method: 使用基于视觉基础模型表示的稀疏自编码器，将概念分类为目标、上下文和偏差类型，通过语义相关性和统计相关性分析实现数据集表征、偏差识别和鲁棒性评估。

Result: 在多种视觉概念（如物体、纹理、背景、面部属性等）上验证有效，能可靠检测已知偏差（如水鸟数据集背景偏差）并发现未标注偏差（如ImageNet中的共现物体）。

Conclusion: ConceptScope为数据集审计和模型诊断提供了实用工具，通过概念激活产生与语义区域对齐的空间归因。

Abstract: Dataset bias, where data points are skewed to certain concepts, is ubiquitous
in machine learning datasets. Yet, systematically identifying these biases is
challenging without costly, fine-grained attribute annotations. We present
ConceptScope, a scalable and automated framework for analyzing visual datasets
by discovering and quantifying human-interpretable concepts using Sparse
Autoencoders trained on representations from vision foundation models.
ConceptScope categorizes concepts into target, context, and bias types based on
their semantic relevance and statistical correlation to class labels, enabling
class-level dataset characterization, bias identification, and robustness
evaluation through concept-based subgrouping. We validate that ConceptScope
captures a wide range of visual concepts, including objects, textures,
backgrounds, facial attributes, emotions, and actions, through comparisons with
annotated datasets. Furthermore, we show that concept activations produce
spatial attributions that align with semantically meaningful image regions.
ConceptScope reliably detects known biases (e.g., background bias in
Waterbirds) and uncovers previously unannotated ones (e.g, co-occurring objects
in ImageNet), offering a practical tool for dataset auditing and model
diagnostics.

Abstract: 3D human pose estimation from sketches has broad applications in computer
animation and film production. Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this
task presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature
of sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of
large-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with
heuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in
generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
leveraging a "learn from synthesis" strategy. First, a diffusion model is
trained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human
poses, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process
enables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k
accurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building
on this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for
estimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework
combines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch
feature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose
estimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee
geometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses
while preserving accurate self-contacts. Qualitative, quantitative, and
subjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses
previous ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.

Abstract: The sustainability of supply chain plays a key role in achieving optimal
performance in controlling the supply chain. The management of risks that occur
in a supply chain is a fundamental problem for the purpose of developing the
sustainability of the network and elevating the performance efficiency of the
supply chain. The correct classification of products is another essential
element in a sustainable supply chain. Acknowledging recent breakthroughs in
the context of deep networks, several architectural options have been deployed
to analyze supply chain datasets. A novel geometric deep network is used to
propose an ensemble deep network. The proposed Chebyshev ensemble geometric
network (Ch-EGN) is a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning. This
network is proposed to leverage the information dependencies in supply chain to
derive invisible states of samples in the database. The functionality of the
proposed deep network is assessed on the two different databases. The
SupplyGraph Dataset and DataCo are considered in this research. The prediction
of delivery status of DataCo supply chain is done for risk administration. The
product classification and edge classification are performed using the
SupplyGraph database to enhance the sustainability of the supply network. An
average accuracy of 98.95% is obtained for the ensemble network for risk
management. The average accuracy of 100% and 98.07% are obtained for
sustainable supply chain in terms of 5 product group classification and 4
product relation classification, respectively. The average accuracy of 92.37%
is attained for 25 company relation classification. The results confirm an
average improvement and efficiency of the proposed method compared to the
state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: 该论文针对文档布局生成的不足，提出了百万级多样化文档布局数据集OmniLayout-1M，并开发了从粗到细两阶段学习的OmniLayout-LLM模型，在多个领域实现优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文档AI研究主要关注文档布局分析，而文档布局生成研究不足。现有数据集中学术论文等Manhattan风格布局占主导，真实世界文档类型如报纸杂志等严重缺乏代表性。

Method: 提出两阶段从粗到细学习范式：1) 使用粗粒度类别从OmniLayout-1M数据集学习通用布局原则；2) 将知识迁移到具有细粒度标注的特定领域。开发了0.5B参数的OmniLayout-LLM模型。

Result: 在M^6Doc数据集的多个领域中，该方法显著超越了现有的布局生成专家模型和多个最新的通用大语言模型，表现出强大的性能。

Conclusion: OmniLayout-1M数据集和OmniLayout-LLM模型有效解决了文档布局生成领域的多样性和复杂性挑战，为文档AI的生成能力提供了重要推动。代码、模型和数据集将公开发布。

Abstract: Document AI has advanced rapidly and is attracting increasing attention. Yet,
while most efforts have focused on document layout analysis (DLA), its
generative counterpart, document layout generation, remains underexplored. A
major obstacle lies in the scarcity of diverse layouts: academic papers with
Manhattan-style structures dominate existing studies, while open-world genres
such as newspapers and magazines remain severely underrepresented. To address
this gap, we curate OmniLayout-1M, the first million-scale dataset of diverse
document layouts, covering six common document types and comprising
contemporary layouts collected from multiple sources. Moreover, since existing
methods struggle in complex domains and often fail to arrange long sequences
coherently, we introduce OmniLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model with designed two-stage
Coarse-to-Fine learning paradigm: 1) learning universal layout principles from
OmniLayout-1M with coarse category definitions, and 2) transferring the
knowledge to a specific domain with fine-grained annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on
multiple domains in M$^{6}$Doc dataset, substantially surpassing both existing
layout generation experts and several latest general-purpose LLMs. Our code,
models, and dataset will be publicly released.

Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在多模态任务表现出色，但对其时间信息理解能力的评估不足，特别是视频中的时间方向判断能力。

Method: 开发了AoT-PsyPhyBENCH基准测试，使用人类心理物理学验证的刺激材料，评估VLMs判断短片正反向播放的能力。

Result: 大多数开放权重和专有模型在物理不可逆过程和因果手动动作识别任务上表现接近随机水平，最佳模型也远落后于人类准确率。

Conclusion: 当前多模态系统存在根本性缺陷：虽然能捕捉丰富的视觉语义关联，但缺乏时间连续性和因果理解的归纳偏置。

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet
their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially,
under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing
challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played
forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated
benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural
videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans.
Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and
non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the
best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g.,
free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition)
that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental
gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic
correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity
and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to
encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities
of VLMs.

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种受人类认知规律启发的新型红外与可见光图像融合方法HCLFuse。该方法通过多尺度掩码调节变分瓶颈编码器提取精准的低阶模态信息，并融合扩散模型的概率生成能力与物理规律，形成了时间变化的物理引导机制，在多个数据集上实现了最优的融合性能。

Method: HCLFuse方法包括两个核心部分：1）多尺度掩码调节变分瓶颈编码器，通过后验概率建模和信息分解提取精准简洁的低阶模态信息；2）将扩散模型的概率生成能力与物理规律结合，形成时间变化的物理引导机制，自适应调节生成过程。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个数据集的定性和定量评估中均达到最先进的融合性能，并显著提升了语义分割指标。

Conclusion: 从人类认知中汲取灵感的生成式图像融合方法在增强结构一致性和细节质量方面具有明显优势，为图像融合领域提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Existing infrared and visible image fusion methods often face the dilemma of
balancing modal information. Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images
by learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain
limited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection
further affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex
scenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion
under the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and
visible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the
quantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks,
which leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational
bottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and
information decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal
information, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural
details. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion
model is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical
guidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at
different stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the
intrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
fusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple
datasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics. This fully
demonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method, drawing
inspiration from human cognition, in enhancing structural consistency and
detail quality.

Motivation: 探索不同复杂度CNN网络在远距离periocular（眼周）验证中的互补性，以提升识别性能。

Method: 在VGGFace2的眼部图像上训练三种CNN架构（SqueezeNet、MobileNetv2、ResNet50），使用余弦和chi2度量分析性能，比较不同网络初始化，通过逻辑回归进行分数级融合，并利用LIME热图和Jensen-Shannon散度比较注意力模式。

Result: ResNet50单独性能最佳，但三种网络融合后性能显著提升，特别是三者组合时。热图显示不同网络关注图像的不同区域，解释了它们的互补性。

Conclusion: 多网络融合策略在UBIPr数据库上显著优于以往工作，实现了新的state-of-the-art性能，证明了不同CNN架构在periocular验证中的有效互补性。

Abstract: We study the complementarity of different CNNs for periocular verification at
different distances on the UBIPr database. We train three architectures of
increasing complexity (SqueezeNet, MobileNetv2, and ResNet50) on a large set of
eye crops from VGGFace2. We analyse performance with cosine and chi2 metrics,
compare different network initialisations, and apply score-level fusion via
logistic regression. In addition, we use LIME heatmaps and Jensen-Shannon
divergence to compare attention patterns of the CNNs. While ResNet50
consistently performs best individually, the fusion provides substantial gains,
especially when combining all three networks. Heatmaps show that networks
usually focus on distinct regions of a given image, which explains their
complementarity. Our method significantly outperforms previous works on UBIPr,
achieving a new state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 现有模仿学习方法存在模式崩溃问题，无法生成多样化轨迹；生成式方法难以直接融入安全约束，需要额外优化阶段。

Method: 采用约束流匹配方法，在流匹配过程中直接施加显式约束，确保轨迹符合安全和运动学规则；将驾驶激进程度参数化为控制信号。

Result: 在NavSim v2挑战赛中取得第二名，EPDMS得分为51.31，并获得创新奖。

Conclusion: CATG通过约束流匹配有效解决了模式崩溃问题，实现了约束条件下的多样化轨迹生成，展示了在实际自动驾驶场景中的优越性能。

Abstract: Planning is a critical component of end-to-end autonomous driving. However,
prevailing imitation learning methods often suffer from mode collapse, failing
to produce diverse trajectory hypotheses. Meanwhile, existing generative
approaches struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints
directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization
stage to refine their outputs. To address these limitations, we propose CATG, a
novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely,
CATG explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates
mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning
signals. Our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit
constraints directly within the flow matching process, ensuring that the
generated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules. Secondly,
CATG parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during
generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Notably, on the
NavSim v2 challenge, CATG achieved 2nd place with an EPDMS score of 51.31 and
was honored with the Innovation Award.

Result: 在不受控制的VGGFace2-Pose数据集上，眼周识别的等错误率为9-15%，明显高于全脸图像的3-6%。在控制良好的UFPR-Periocular数据集上取得了1-2%的EER，这是该数据集上迄今报告的最低错误率。

Conclusion: 眼周生物识别技术在高质量控制条件下可以取得优异性能，图像质量和采集协议的一致性对识别性能有显著影响，大规模训练数据有助于提升模型性能。

Abstract: We focus on ocular biometrics, specifically the periocular region (the area
around the eye), which offers high discrimination and minimal acquisition
constraints. We evaluate three Convolutional Neural Network architectures of
varying depth and complexity to assess their effectiveness for periocular
recognition. The networks are trained on 1,907,572 ocular crops extracted from
the large-scale VGGFace2 database. This significantly contrasts with existing
works, which typically rely on small-scale periocular datasets for training
having only a few thousand images. Experiments are conducted with ocular images
from VGGFace2-Pose, a subset of VGGFace2 containing in-the-wild face images,
and the UFPR-Periocular database, which consists of selfies captured via mobile
devices with user guidance on the screen. Due to the uncontrolled conditions of
VGGFace2, the Equal Error Rates (EERs) obtained with ocular crops range from
9-15%, noticeably higher than the 3-6% EERs achieved using full-face images. In
contrast, UFPR-Periocular yields significantly better performance (EERs of
1-2%), thanks to higher image quality and more consistent acquisition
protocols. To the best of our knowledge, these are the lowest reported EERs on
the UFPR dataset to date.

Abstract: Agile Earth Observation Satellites (AEOSs) constellations offer unprecedented
flexibility for monitoring the Earth's surface, but their scheduling remains
challenging under large-scale scenarios, dynamic environments, and stringent
constraints. Existing methods often simplify these complexities, limiting their
real-world performance. We address this gap with a unified framework
integrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model. Our
benchmark suite, AEOS-Bench, contains $3,907$ finely tuned satellite assets and
$16,410$ scenarios. Each scenario features $1$ to $50$ satellites and $50$ to
$300$ imaging tasks. These scenarios are generated via a high-fidelity
simulation platform, ensuring realistic satellite behavior such as orbital
dynamics and resource constraints. Ground truth scheduling annotations are
provided for each scenario. To our knowledge, AEOS-Bench is the first
large-scale benchmark suite tailored for realistic constellation scheduling.
Building upon this benchmark, we introduce AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based
scheduling model that incorporates a constraint-aware attention mechanism. A
dedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and
operational limits of each satellite. Through simulation-based iterative
learning, AEOS-Former adapts to diverse scenarios, offering a robust solution
for AEOS constellation scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that
AEOS-Former outperforms baseline models in task completion and energy
efficiency, with ablation studies highlighting the contribution of each
component. Code and data are provided in

Motivation: 现有基于单一CNN或ViT的DR诊断系统由于各自模型的局限性，性能已达到瓶颈。为了充分利用CNN的局部特征提取能力和ViT的全局特征捕获能力，需要一种有效融合不同骨干网络特征的方法。

Method: 提出基于证据理论的融合范式，通过一组深度证据网络将不同骨干网络的特征转换为支持证据，形成聚合意见，自适应调节融合模式以提升混合模型性能。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的基于证据理论的融合方法有效地突破了DR诊断系统的性能瓶颈，在提升准确性的同时增强了模型的可解释性，为医学图像分析提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss among middle-aged
and elderly people, which significantly impacts their daily lives and mental
health. To improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early
detection of DR, a variety of automated DR diagnosis systems have been recently
established based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision Transformer
(ViT). However, due to the own shortages of CNN / ViT, the performance of
existing methods using single-type backbone has reached a bottleneck. One
potential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of
backbones, which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them
(\emph{i.e.,} the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global
feature capturing ability of ViT). To this end, we propose a novel paradigm to
effectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the
theory of evidence. Specifically, the proposed evidential fusion paradigm
transforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via
a set of deep evidential networks. With the supporting evidences, the
aggregated opinion can be accordingly formed, which can be used to adaptively
tune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the
performance of our hybrid model. We evaluated our method on two publicly
available DR grading datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our
hybrid model not only improves the accuracy of DR grading, compared to the
state-of-the-art frameworks, but also provides the excellent interpretability
for feature fusion and decision-making.

### [38] [GLYPH-SR: Can We Achieve Both High-Quality Image Super-Resolution and High-Fidelity Text Recovery via VLM-guided Latent Diffusion Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26339)
*Mingyu Sung,Seungjae Ham,Kangwoo Kim,Yeokyoung Yoon,Sangseok Yun,Il-Min Kim,Jae-Mo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLYPH-SR is a vision-language-guided diffusion framework that specifically optimizes for text legibility in image super-resolution, addressing the limitations of previous methods that treat scene-text as generic texture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scene-text in images carries critical actionable information, but traditional super-resolution methods tuned to distortion or perceptual metrics are insensitive to character-level errors, causing OCR failures even when the rest of the image appears sharp.

Method: GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet guided by OCR data and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and scene-centric guidance, trained on synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.

Result: Across multiple benchmarks at x4 and x8 scale factors, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by up to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baselines while maintaining competitive perceptual quality metrics.

Conclusion: GLYPH-SR successfully delivers super-resolution that achieves both high readability and high visual realism, producing results that both look right and read right.

Abstract: Image super-resolution(SR) is fundamental to many vision system-from
surveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analytics-because
recovering high-frequency details, especially scene-text, enables reliable
downstream perception. Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such
as signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable
information; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character
recognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image
appears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion
(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that
are largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do
address text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,
overlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,
scene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in
practical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for
both text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a
vision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives
jointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by
OCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and
scene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these
components on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.
Across SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by
up to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)
while maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed
to satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual
realism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.

Motivation: 现有EEG驱动的图像重建方法忽视了空间注意机制，导致重建图像的保真度和语义一致性受限。

Method: 提出的双条件框架使用自适应思维映射器提取EEG特征，通过LoRA微调Stable Diffusion 2.1将神经信号与视觉语义对齐，同时使用ControlNet分支基于显著图实现空间控制。

Abstract: Existing EEG-driven image reconstruction methods often overlook spatial
attention mechanisms, limiting fidelity and semantic coherence. To address
this, we propose a dual-conditioning framework that combines EEG embeddings
with spatial saliency maps to enhance image generation. Our approach leverages
the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) for EEG feature extraction and fine-tunes
Stable Diffusion 2.1 via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to align neural signals
with visual semantics, while a ControlNet branch conditions generation on
saliency maps for spatial control. Evaluated on THINGS-EEG, our method achieves
a significant improvement in the quality of low- and high-level image features
over existing approaches. Simultaneously, strongly aligning with human visual
attention. The results demonstrate that attentional priors resolve EEG
ambiguities, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions with applications in
medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive interfaces, advancing neural decoding

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出的LoCoT2V-Bench基准，用于评估复杂条件下的长视频生成，包含多维度评估框架和新的度量标准，发现现有模型在高级语义一致性方面存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成评估主要基于简化提示和低层次指标，忽略了与提示的细粒度对齐以及叙事连贯性等抽象维度，需要专为长视频复杂输入设计的基准。

Method: 基于真实世界视频构建包含场景转换和事件动态的现实复杂提示集，建立多维度评估框架，提出事件级对齐、细粒度时间一致性、内容清晰度和人类期望实现度等新指标。

Result: 对9个代表性长视频生成模型的评估表明，现有方法在基本视觉和时间方面表现良好，但在事件间一致性、细粒度对齐和高级主题遵循等方面存在困难。

Conclusion: LoCoT2V-Bench为长形式复杂文本到视频生成提供了全面可靠的评估平台，并指明了未来方法改进的关键方向。

Abstract: Recently text-to-video generation has made impressive progress in producing
short, high-quality clips, but evaluating long-form outputs remains a major
challenge especially when processing complex prompts. Existing benchmarks
mostly rely on simplified prompts and focus on low-level metrics, overlooking
fine-grained alignment with prompts and abstract dimensions such as narrative
coherence and thematic expression. To address these gaps, we propose
LoCoT2V-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video generation
(LVG) under complex input conditions. Based on various real-world videos,
LoCoT2V-Bench introduces a suite of realistic and complex prompts incorporating
elements like scene transitions and event dynamics. Moreover, it constructs a
multi-dimensional evaluation framework that includes our newly proposed metrics
such as event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content
clarity, and the Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD) that focuses on
more abstract attributes like narrative flow, emotional response, and character
development. Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
nine representative LVG models, finding that while current methods perform well
on basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event
consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence, etc.
Overall, LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for
evaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical
directions for future method improvement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出A-TPT框架，通过引入角度多样性来提升视觉语言模型的校准性能。该方法在保持准确性的同时显著降低了平均校准误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时提示调优方法没有充分关注角度多样性，这影响了文本特征的分散性和模型的校准性能。

Method: A-TPT框架通过最大化归一化文本特征在单位超球面上的最小成对角度距离来增强角度多样性。

Result: A-TPT在不同骨干网络和数据集上均优于现有TPT方法，尤其在自然分布偏移和医疗数据集上展示出优秀的零样本校准性能。

Conclusion: 提升角度多样性可以显著改善视觉语言模型在校准测试时适配的性能，为模型可靠性和安全性提供重要保障。

Abstract: Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) has emerged as a promising technique for
adapting large vision-language models (VLMs) to unseen tasks without relying on
labeled data. However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt
calibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,
trustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on
improving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature
dispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular
separation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular
separation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the
critical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel
TPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the
distribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable
prompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular
distance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate
average calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through
extensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably,
our approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural
distribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide
extensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding
of A-TPT. These results highlight the potency of promoting angular diversity to
achieve well-dispersed textual features, significantly improving VLM
calibration during test-time adaptation. Our code will be made publicly
available.

TL;DR: 本文将基础3D重建模型（如DUSt3R和MASt3R）适配用于点跟踪任务，通过3D基础对应关系。该方法在静态点跟踪上表现优异，结合动态对应训练和可见性头，在多个数据集上达到竞争性或超越现有技术的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础3D重建模型在静态场景的2D和3D对应方面显示出巨大潜力，但尚未充分应用于点跟踪任务。本文旨在将这些模型适配用于点跟踪，特别是通过3D基础对应关系来提升性能。

Method: 1. 将DUSt3R和MASt3R模型适配用于点跟踪任务；2. 结合重建损失与动态对应训练，并添加可见性头；3. 使用少量合成数据对MASt3R进行微调；4. 仅在包含查询点的帧对上进行训练和评估，移除时间上下文。

Result: 在四个数据集上取得竞争性或优越结果：TAP-Vid-DAVIS上PointSt3R达到73.8 δ_avg/85.8%遮挡准确率（CoTracker2为75.7/88.3%）；在EgoPoints上显著超越CoTracker3（61.3 vs 54.2）；在RGB-S上也表现更优（87.0 vs 82.8）。静态点跟踪在EgoPoints上比CoTracker2提升33.5%。

Conclusion: 通过将基础3D重建模型适配用于点跟踪任务，并结合动态对应训练和可见性头，该方法在多个基准测试中取得了竞争性或超越现有技术的性能，证明了3D基础对应在点跟踪中的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundational 3D reconstruction models, such as DUSt3R and
MASt3R, have shown great potential in 2D and 3D correspondence in static
scenes. In this paper, we propose to adapt them for the task of point tracking
through 3D grounded correspondence. We first demonstrate that these models are
competitive point trackers when focusing on static points, present in current
point tracking benchmarks ($+33.5\%$ on EgoPoints vs. CoTracker2). We propose
to combine the reconstruction loss with training for dynamic correspondence
along with a visibility head, and fine-tuning MASt3R for point tracking using a
relatively small amount of synthetic data. Importantly, we only train and
evaluate on pairs of frames where one contains the query point, effectively
removing any temporal context. Using a mix of dynamic and static point
correspondences, we achieve competitive or superior point tracking results on
four datasets (e.g. competitive on TAP-Vid-DAVIS 73.8 $\delta_{avg}$ / 85.8\%
occlusion acc. for PointSt3R compared to 75.7 / 88.3\% for CoTracker2; and
significantly outperform CoTracker3 on EgoPoints 61.3 vs 54.2 and RGB-S 87.0 vs
82.8). We also present results on 3D point tracking along with several
ablations on training datasets and percentage of dynamic correspondences.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出FineGrainedAD框架解决少样本异常检测中的语义对齐问题，通过多级细粒度语义描述和语义对齐机制提升异常定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于VLMs的FSAD方法因缺乏细粒度文本描述，只能使用图像级描述进行语义匹配，导致图像描述与局部视觉异常之间的语义不对齐。

Method: 提出MFSC自动生成多级细粒度文本描述，包含MLLP（通过自动替换和拼接机制增强可学习提示）和MLSA（区域聚合策略和多级对齐训练）。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集上，FineGrainedAD在少样本设置下实现了优异的整体性能。

Conclusion: MFSC和FineGrainedAD框架能够有效解决语义对齐问题，显著提升少样本异常检测的定位精度。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) methods identify anomalous regions with few
known normal samples. Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability
of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous
regions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images.
However, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can
only pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to
identify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment
between image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving
sub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose
the Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and
fine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with
automatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel
framework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance,
which consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and
Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics
into multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and
concatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and
multi-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align
with corresponding visual regions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
FineGrainedAD achieves superior overall performance in few-shot settings on
MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型中物体-上下文联系导致的偏见问题，这种偏见会降低模型在面对与训练数据不同场景时的零样本可靠性。

Method: 将问题重构为因果推理问题，在CLIP表示空间中估计物体和背景的期望，通过组合物体特征与来自外部数据集、批次邻居或文本描述的替代上下文生成反事实嵌入，并利用总直接效应估计和干预模拟来减去仅背景激活。

Result: 方法在上下文敏感基准测试中显著提升了最差组和平均准确率，建立了新的零样本最优性能。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一个轻量级的表示级反事实方法，为实现无偏见和可靠的多模态推理提供了实用的因果途径。

Abstract: Object-context shortcuts remain a persistent challenge in vision-language
models, undermining zero-shot reliability when test-time scenes differ from
familiar training co-occurrences. We recast this issue as a causal inference
problem and ask: Would the prediction remain if the object appeared in a
different environment? To answer this at inference time, we estimate object and
background expectations within CLIP's representation space, and synthesize
counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse
alternative contexts sampled from external datasets, batch neighbors, or
text-derived descriptions. By estimating the Total Direct Effect and simulating
intervention, we further subtract background-only activation, preserving
beneficial object-context interactions while mitigating hallucinated scores.
Without retraining or prompt design, our method substantially improves both
worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, establishing
a new zero-shot state of the art. Beyond performance, our framework provides a
lightweight representation-level counterfactual approach, offering a practical
causal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: 提出的头尾再平衡策略有效缓解了自改进过程中的马太效应，突破了性能瓶颈，为大视觉语言模型的推理能力提升提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models
explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we
identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating
high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles
with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced
optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while
hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,
this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the "Matthew
effect"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to
performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four
efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and
trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the
exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on
Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks
demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning
capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

Abstract: The edge detection task is essential in image processing aiming to extract
relevant information from an image. One recurring problem in this task is the
weaknesses found in some detectors, such as the difficulty in detecting loose
edges and the lack of context to extract relevant information from specific
problems. To address these weaknesses and adapt the detector to the properties
of an image, an adaptable detector described by two-dimensional cellular
automaton and optimized by meta-heuristic combined with transfer learning
techniques was developed. This study aims to analyze the impact of expanding
the search space of the optimization phase and the robustness of the
adaptability of the detector in identifying edges of a set of natural images
and specialized subsets extracted from the same image set. The results obtained
prove that expanding the search space of the optimization phase was not
effective for the chosen image set. The study also analyzed the adaptability of
the model through a series of experiments and validation techniques and found
that, regardless of the validation, the model was able to adapt to the input
and the transfer learning techniques applied to the model showed no significant
improvements.

Abstract: Spine segmentation, based on ultrasound volume projection imaging (VPI),
plays a vital role for intelligent scoliosis diagnosis in clinical
applications. However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly,
the global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect
the high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine
bones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,
which deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network
(SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a
scale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional
long-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the
consistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic
level affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform
semantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a
Transformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a
feature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method
improves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The
experimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior
segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover,
the adaptability of SA$^{2}$Net to various backbones enhances its potential as
a promising tool for advanced scoliosis diagnosis using intelligent spinal
image analysis. The code and experimental demo are available at

Motivation: 传统广告多版本制作依赖人工编辑，耗时耗力；现有视频摘要方法忽视音频在广告中的重要性。

Method: 开发两流音视频融合模型预测视频帧重要性，定义重要性为帧被选入短广告的概率；构建AdSum204数据集（102对30秒/15秒广告）。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了广告视频自动剪辑问题，强调音频重要性，并通过新数据集和实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at
varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves
manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter
versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we
introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization
techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection
problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video
summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach
emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we
develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of
video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being
selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific
datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of
30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve,
Spearman, and Kendall.

Abstract: In real-world environments, AI systems often face unfamiliar scenarios
without labeled data, creating a major challenge for conventional scene
understanding models. The inability to generalize across unseen contexts limits
the deployment of vision-based applications in dynamic, unstructured settings.
This work introduces a Dynamic Context-Aware Scene Reasoning framework that
leverages Vision-Language Alignment to address zero-shot real-world scenarios.
The goal is to enable intelligent systems to infer and adapt to new
environments without prior task-specific training. The proposed approach
integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align
visual semantics with natural language descriptions, enhancing contextual
comprehension. A dynamic reasoning module refines predictions by combining
global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors.
Extensive experiments on zero-shot benchmarks such as COCO, Visual Genome, and
Open Images demonstrate up to 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy
over baseline models in complex and unseen environments. Results also show
robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to the synergistic
fusion of vision and language. This framework offers a scalable and
interpretable approach for context-aware reasoning, advancing zero-shot
generalization in dynamic real-world settings.

Motivation: 现有VQA模型在跨域场景（如遥感、医疗、数学图表）下泛化能力显著下降，而传统方法依赖昂贵的领域微调或定制化流程，缺乏灵活性和可扩展性。

Method: 提出解耦视觉和语言适应的机制：引入领域分类器识别图像类型，并通过双适配器（提示适配器和视觉适配器）动态调整语言提示和视觉特征，所有模块通过统一钩子接口注入。

Result: 在四个领域特定VQA基准测试中取得一致性能提升：MathVQA上BLEU提升2.3，MedVQA-RAD上VQA得分提升2.6，ChartQA上ROUGE提升3.1。

Conclusion: CATCH提供了一种可扩展的多域VQA解决方案，仅需最小架构改动即可实现跨域部署，为实际应用提供了灵活高效的适应机制。

Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated
impressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA
leveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,
their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain
scenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to
large distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation
mechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or
bespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across
diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for
cross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while
requiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to
decouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight
modules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual
adapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a
Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically
injected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone
model. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without
retraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on
MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH
provides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling
practical deployment across diverse application domains.

Abstract: We introduce Emu3.5, a large-scale multimodal world model that natively
predicts the next state across vision and language. Emu3.5 is pre-trained
end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of
vision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily
derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model
naturally accepts interleaved vision-language inputs and generates interleaved
vision-language outputs. Emu3.5 is further post-trained with large-scale
reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation. To
improve inference efficiency, we propose Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA),
which converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction,
accelerating per-image inference by about 20x without sacrificing performance.
Emu3.5 exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities, including long-horizon
vision-language generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex
text-rich image generation. It also exhibits generalizable world-modeling
abilities, enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and
open-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks. For
comparison, Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image

results on a suite of interleaved generation tasks. We open-source Emu3.5 at

Abstract: Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite
being an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about
finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph
that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to
reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,
stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,
we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow
matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4
diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results
against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,
demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and
perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly
effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given
low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that
ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior
distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,
enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can
guide future users to reject uncertain predictions.

TL;DR: CYPRESS模型利用预训练的地理空间基础模型Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M，通过连续回归任务实现高分辨率田间作物产量预测，在加拿大草原数据集上表现优于现有深度学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统作物产量预测方法缺乏可扩展性和精细度，无法满足精准农业的需求。

Method: 利用预训练的大规模地理空间基础模型（Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M），通过多时相卫星影像进行连续回归任务，生成像素级产量地图。

Result: 在加拿大草原数据集上的评估显示，CYPRESS模型在油菜产量预测方面优于现有的深度学习模型。

Conclusion: 该研究验证了将大规模地球观测与农场决策相结合的新方法，为精细农业监测提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and timely crop yield prediction is crucial for global food security
and modern agricultural management. Traditional methods often lack the
scalability and granularity required for precision farming. This paper
introduces CYPRESS (Crop Yield Prediction via Regression on Prithvi's Encoder
for Satellite Sensing), a deep learning model designed for high-resolution,
intra-field canola yield prediction. CYPRESS leverages a pre-trained,
large-scale geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M) and adapts it for
a continuous regression task, transforming multi-temporal satellite imagery
into dense, pixel-level yield maps. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from
the Canadian Prairies, CYPRESS demonstrates superior performance over existing
deep learning-based yield prediction models, highlighting the effectiveness of
fine-tuning foundation models for specialized agricultural applications. By
providing a continuous, high-resolution output, CYPRESS offers a more
actionable tool for precision agriculture than conventional classification or
county-level aggregation methods. This work validates a novel approach that
bridges the gap between large-scale Earth observation and on-farm
decision-making, offering a scalable solution for detailed agricultural
monitoring.

*Christoffer Koo Øhrstrøm,Ronja Güldenring,Lazaros Nalpantidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Spiking Patches：一种为事件相机设计的Token化方法，通过保持事件的异步和空间稀疏性特性，在保持精度的同时提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将事件表示为帧或体素会破坏事件相机的异步和空间稀疏性特性，需要一种能够保持这些特性的表示方法。

Method: 提出Spiking Patches tokenizer，将异步稀疏事件流转换为token表示，保持原始事件特性，并采用GNN、PCN和Transformer进行验证。

Result: 相比体素和帧表示，推理速度分别提升3.4倍和10.4倍，在手势识别和物体检测任务中精度相当甚至更好（绝对提升分别达3.8和1.4）。

Conclusion: 事件token化是事件视觉的新方向，为保持事件相机特性的方法迈出重要一步。

Abstract: We propose tokenization of events and present a tokenizer, Spiking Patches,
specifically designed for event cameras. Given a stream of asynchronous and
spatially sparse events, our goal is to discover an event representation that
preserves these properties. Prior works have represented events as frames or as
voxels. However, while these representations yield high accuracy, both frames
and voxels are synchronous and decrease the spatial sparsity. Spiking Patches
gives the means to preserve the unique properties of event cameras and we show
in our experiments that this comes without sacrificing accuracy. We evaluate
our tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and
object detection. Tokens from Spiking Patches yield inference times that are up
to 3.4x faster than voxel-based tokens and up to 10.4x faster than frames. We
achieve this while matching their accuracy and even surpassing in some cases
with absolute improvements up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and up to 1.4 for
object detection. Thus, tokenization constitutes a novel direction in
event-based vision and marks a step towards methods that preserve the
properties of event cameras.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are transforming the future of transportation
through advances in intelligent perception, decision-making, and control
systems. However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object
detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in
Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable
progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains
fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative
intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking
analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI
rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically
reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR,
and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their
capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their
potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception
frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that
moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based,
and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a
cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze
cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to
hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven
approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language
Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey
delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future
opportunities.

### [57] [Towards Reliable Sea Ice Drift Estimation in the Arctic Deep Learning Optical Flow on RADARSAT-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26653)
*Daniela Martin,Joseph Gallego*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文首次大规模评估了48个深度学习光流模型在RADARSAT-2 ScanSAR海冰影像上的性能，证明了深度学习方法相比传统方法在海冰漂移估计中的显著优势，多项模型达到亚公里级精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海冰漂移准确估计对北极航行、气候研究和业务预报至关重要。传统光流方法依赖数学模型和强假设，限制了在复杂场景下的准确性。深度学习光流方法在计算机视觉领域已取得重大进展，但其在地球物理问题和卫星SAR影像中的应用仍有待探索。

Method: 研究使用48个深度学习光流模型处理RADARSAT-2 ScanSAR海冰影像，通过端点误差(EPE)和Fl全指标与GNSS追踪浮标进行对比评估。

Result: 多个模型达到亚公里级精度（EPE 6-8像素，300-400米），误差相对于海冰运动空间尺度和北极典型导航需求较小。模型能够捕捉一致的区域漂移模式，深度学习方法相比传统方法显著提高了运动估计精度。

Conclusion: 深度学习光流方法可以有效地迁移到极地遥感应用，能够生成空间连续的海冰漂移场，为每个图像像素提供运动估计，为导航和气候建模提供了新的机会。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of sea ice drift is critical for Arctic navigation,
climate research, and operational forecasting. While optical flow, a computer
vision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images,
has advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical
problems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical
flow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion,
which limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based
approaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in
computer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We
present the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models
on RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and
Fl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer
accuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the
spatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the
Arctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing
consistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical
flow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy
compared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote
sensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing
motion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations,
offering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.

Abstract: The presence of occlusions has provided substantial challenges to
typically-powerful object recognition algorithms. Additional sources of
information can be extremely valuable to reduce errors caused by occlusions.
Scene context is known to aid in object recognition in biological vision. In
this work, we attempt to add robustness into existing Region Proposal
Network-Deep Convolutional Neural Network (RPN-DCNN) object detection networks
through two distinct scene-based information fusion techniques. We present one
algorithm under each methodology: the first operates prior to prediction,
selecting a custom object network to use based on the identified background
scene, and the second operates after detection, fusing scene knowledge into
initial object scores output by the RPN. We demonstrate our algorithms on
challenging datasets featuring partial occlusions, which show overall
improvement in both recall and precision against baseline methods. In addition,
our experiments contrast multiple training methodologies for occlusion
handling, finding that training on a combination of both occluded and
unoccluded images demonstrates an improvement over the others. Our method is
interpretable and can easily be adapted to other datasets, offering many future
directions for research and practical applications.

<details>

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型(VLM)在遵循复杂指令方面存在不足，需要一种无需修改模型权重就能在推理时进行精细控制的方法。

Method: 从包含目标行为和对立行为的提示对中学习潜在嵌入，通过维度激活调制和跨层自适应转向动态调整激活连接。

Result: SteerVLM仅需原始VLM参数量的0.14%，在转向和幻缓解基准测试中优于现有干预技术，并提出VNIA数据集用于评估。

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态模型控制提供了通过激活工程的鲁棒解决方案，实现了有效的推理时语义转向。

Abstract: This work introduces SteerVLM, a lightweight steering module designed to
guide Vision-Language Models (VLMs) towards outputs that better adhere to
desired instructions. Our approach learns from the latent embeddings of paired
prompts encoding target and converse behaviors to dynamically adjust
activations connecting the language modality with image context. This allows
for fine-grained, inference-time control over complex output semantics without
modifying model weights while preserving performance on off-target tasks. Our
steering module requires learning parameters equal to 0.14% of the original
VLM's size. Our steering module gains model control through dimension-wise
activation modulation and adaptive steering across layers without requiring
pre-extracted static vectors or manual tuning of intervention points.
Furthermore, we introduce VNIA (Visual Narrative Intent Alignment), a
multimodal dataset specifically created to facilitate the development and
evaluation of VLM steering techniques. Our method outperforms existing
intervention techniques on steering and hallucination mitigation benchmarks for
VLMs and proposes a robust solution for multimodal model control through
activation engineering.

Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of
irreversible vision impairment in people over the age of 60. This research
focuses on semantic segmentation for AMD lesion detection in RGB fundus images,
a non-invasive and cost-effective imaging technique. The results of the ADAM

research competition and open dataset to date - serve as a benchmark for our
evaluation. Taking the U-Net connectivity as a base of our framework, we
evaluate and compare several approaches to improve the segmentation model's
architecture and training pipeline, including pre-processing techniques,
encoder (backbone) deep network types of varying complexity, and specialized
loss functions to mitigate class imbalances on image and pixel levels. The main
outcome of this research is the final configuration of the AMD detection
framework, which outperforms all the prior ADAM challenge submissions on the
multi-class segmentation of different AMD lesion types in non-invasive RGB
fundus images. The source code used to conduct the experiments presented in

Abstract: Charts play an important role in visualization, reasoning, data analysis, and
the exchange of ideas among humans. However, existing vision-language models
(VLMs) still lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extract
fine-grained structures from charts. Such limitations in chart grounding also
hinder their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them. In this
paper, we introduce a novel "ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB)" to provide a
comprehensive evaluation of VLMs in chart grounding tasks, i.e., extracting
tabular data, localizing visualization elements, and recognizing various
attributes from charts of diverse types and complexities. We design a JSON
template to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically
tailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inference
workflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs' capability to align and
compare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on
several recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases,
weaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding. These
findings highlight the fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chart
understanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthened
in current models.

Abstract: Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including
computer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise
from coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods
to model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic
hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability
across different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion
modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships
directly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based
hierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into
parent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy
inference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent
elemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies
through graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction
approach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and
dynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show
that our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,
and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the
baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,
data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation
applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks. Project Page:

Abstract: Despite recent advances in 3D human motion generation (MoGen) on standard
benchmarks, existing models still face a fundamental bottleneck in their
generalization capability. In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most
notably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization
in modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can
leverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework
that systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key
pillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a
large-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that
integrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions
from web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen
models. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion
triplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose
ViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from
MoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance
efficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that
eliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong
generalization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed
for fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and
generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework
significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human
evaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 该混合方法在大地理范围内实现了细粒度地理定位，证明了结合学习丰富特征表示和航空影像嵌入的有效性，为大规模地理定位提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Determining the precise geographic location of an image at a global scale
remains an unsolved challenge. Standard image retrieval techniques are
inefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is
insufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global
classification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while
cross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain
gap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a
hybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large
geographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification
task during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly
encode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with
embeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of
ground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas
spanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
approach can localize within 200m more than 68\% of queries of a dataset
covering a large part of Europe. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: SEE4D提出了一种无需姿态标注的4D内容生成框架，通过虚拟相机和视图条件修复技术，解决了现有方法中相机运动与场景动态纠缠的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频转4D方法需要手动标注相机姿态，成本高且对自然场景视频不鲁棒。变形加修复方法需要轨迹预测，导致相机运动与场景动态难以分离。

Method: 采用轨迹到相机框架，用固定虚拟相机替代显式轨迹预测。训练视图条件视频修复模型学习几何先验，通过时空自回归推断管道生成连贯的4D内容。

Result: 在跨视图视频生成和稀疏重建基准测试中，SEE4D在定量指标和定性评估上均优于基于姿态或轨迹的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了从随意视频中进行实用的4D世界建模，展示了更好的泛化能力和性能提升。

Abstract: Immersive applications call for synthesizing spatiotemporal 4D content from
casual videos without costly 3D supervision. Existing video-to-4D methods
typically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive
and brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches
mitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera
trajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby
depicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this
trajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene
dynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a
pose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory
prediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby
separating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video
inpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising
realistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing
regions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D
annotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal
autoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and
extends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at
bounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation
and sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and
improved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines,
advancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.

TL;DR: 视频模型如Veo-3在短时空间连贯性、细粒度定位和局部动态一致性方面表现出潜力，但在长时因果推理、严格几何约束和抽象逻辑方面仍有局限，尚不能作为独立的零样本推理器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视频生成模型能产生高保真度、时序一致的视频，暗示其可能编码了丰富的世界知识，但它们在复杂视觉推理场景中是否可作为零样本推理器尚不明确。本研究旨在通过实证研究探究这一问题。

Method: 研究聚焦主流视频模型Veo-3，在12个维度（包括空间、几何、物理、时间等逻辑）评估其推理行为，并构建紧凑基准MME-CoF以标准化评估链式帧推理。

Result: 视频模型在短时空间连贯性、细粒度定位和局部动态一致性上表现良好，但在长时因果推理、严格几何约束和抽象逻辑方面存在明显不足。

Conclusion: 当前视频模型尚不能作为独立的零样本推理器，但可作为专用推理模型的补充视觉引擎，显示出有希望的发展方向。

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent
videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond
realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual
perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still
remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging
visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to
comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular
Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including
spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically
characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,
we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables
in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our
findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning
patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and
locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal
reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are
not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging
signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

TL;DR: MDC通过图像条件掩码扩散语言模型学习视觉特征，在不同位置提供一致的学习信号，下游任务表现竞争力强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少对辅助目标的依赖，提供不依赖序列位置的视觉学习信号。

Method: 训练图像条件掩码扩散语言模型，随机掩码文本标记并重构原始文本。

Result: 线性探测实验显示MDC学习到的视觉特征与自回归和对比方法竞争力相当。

Conclusion: MDC是学习视觉特征的有效方法，在各种模型和数据集上表现良好。

Abstract: We learn visual features by captioning images with an image-conditioned
masked diffusion language model, a formulation we call masked diffusion
captioning (MDC). During training, text tokens in each image-caption pair are
masked at a randomly chosen ratio, and a decoder conditioned on visual features
is trained to reconstruct the original text. After training, the learned visual
features can be applied to downstream vision tasks. Unlike autoregressive
captioning, the strength of the visual learning signal in MDC does not depend
on each token's position in the sequence, reducing the need for auxiliary
objectives. Linear probing experiments across a variety of academic-scale
models and datasets show that the learned visual features are competitive with
those produced by autoregressive and contrastive approaches.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了OmniX框架，这是一个基于全景图的2D提升技术，用于生成适合物理渲染(PBR)、重光照和仿真的图形就绪3D场景。通过重用2D生成先验，该框架实现了对几何、纹理和PBR材料的全景感知。

Motivation: 现有的2D提升方法主要关注外观生成，但忽略了内在属性的感知。本文旨在推进全景技术，生成支持PBR、重光照和仿真的图形就绪3D场景。

Method: 提出OmniX框架，基于轻量高效的跨模态适配器结构，重用2D生成先验进行全景视觉任务。构建大规模合成全景数据集，包含室内外场景的高质量多模态全景图。

Result: 大量实验证明该模型在全景视觉感知和图形就绪3D场景生成方面有效，为沉浸式物理真实虚拟世界生成开辟新可能。

Conclusion: OmniX框架成功将2D提升技术推进到支持物理渲染的图形就绪3D场景生成，通过重用2D生成先验实现了对场景内在属性的全面感知。

Abstract: There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation
and 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a
promising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce
immersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance
this technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically
based rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to
repurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,
and PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize
appearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we
present OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and
efficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for
a broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,
generation, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic
panorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse
indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene
generation, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic
virtual world generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究引入StreetMath基准来评估大语言模型在实际近似场景下的近似推理能力，发现LLM倾向于进行精确计算而非近似推理，且精确与近似算术运算依赖不同的神经组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究主要关注大语言模型在精确算术运算上的表现，但对其在非正式、快速数学运算中的近似推理能力关注不足，特别是在非自回归解码器模型上。

Method: 开发StreetMath基准，对多种LLM架构进行广泛评估，并应用机制可解释性技术分析其内部计算状态。

Result: LLM在需要近似的任务中仍倾向于计算精确值或调用外部工具；尽管有时能在早期层或步骤得到正确答案，但仍消耗更多token；精确和近似算术运算依赖不同的神经组件。

Conclusion: 与人类在街头数学情境中表现出的认知吝啬不同，LLM并未展现出相同的特性，表明其近似推理机制与人类存在差异。

Abstract: There is a substantial body of literature examining the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
performance on precise arithmetic operations in autoregressive architectures.
However, their ability to perform approximate reasoning in informal, fast-paced
mathematical operations has received far less attention, especially among
non-autoregressive decoder models. Our work addresses this gap by introducing
StreetMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' approximation abilities
under real-world approximation scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations
across different LLM architectures: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507,
Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, and
Mamba-GPT-3B. Furthermore, we apply mechanistic interpretability techniques to
probe their internal computational states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs
generally attempt to compute exact values or invoke external tools even in
tasks that call for approximation. Moreover, while models sometimes reach the
correct answer in early layers or steps, they still consume more tokens when
solving approximation tasks. Additional experiments indicate that exact and
approximate arithmetic operations rely on largely separate neural components.
Drawing upon research on cognitive psychology, we argue that LLMs do not
exhibit cognitive miserliness in the same way humans do in street math
settings. We open source our work https://github.com/ctseng777/StreetMath

Motivation: 解决现有基于词典的观点挖掘方法不考虑意见强度（如强烈反对、温和赞同等）的局限，提供更细粒度的情感分析。

Method: 使用模糊逻辑算法对观点词分类，结合句法依存解析找到相关方面词的关系，通过关联特定方面的观点词计算实体得分。

Abstract: Opinion mining, also called sentiment analysis, is the field of study that
analyzes people opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, attitudes, and
emotions towards entities such as products, services, organizations,
individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes. Holistic
lexicon-based approach does not consider the strength of each opinion, i.e.,
whether the opinion is very strongly negative (or positive), strongly negative
(or positive), moderate negative (or positive), very weakly negative (or
positive) and weakly negative (or positive). In this paper, we propose approach
to rank entities based on orientation and strength of the entity reviews and
user's queries by classifying them in granularity levels (i.e. very weak, weak,
moderate, very strong and strong) by combining opinion words (i.e. adverb,
adjective, noun and verb) that are related to aspect of interest of certain
product. We shall use fuzzy logic algorithmic approach in order to classify
opinion words into different category and syntactic dependency resolution to
find relations for desired aspect words. Opinion words related to certain
aspects of interest are considered to find the entity score for that aspect in
the review.

Abstract: Stance detection has emerged as an area of research in the field of
artificial intelligence. However, most research is currently centered on the
target-dependent stance detection task, which is based on a person's stance in
favor of or against a specific target. Furthermore, most benchmark datasets are
based on English, making it difficult to develop models in low-resource
languages such as Korean, especially for an emerging field such as stance
detection. This study proposes the LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance
(LASTIST) dataset to fill this research gap. Collected from the press releases
of both parties on Korean political parties, the LASTIST dataset uses 563,299
labeled Korean sentences. We provide a detailed description of how we collected
and constructed the dataset and trained state-of-the-art deep learning and
stance detection models. Our LASTIST dataset is designed for various tasks in
stance detection, including target-independent stance detection and diachronic
evolution stance detection. We deploy our dataset on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统适配器参数虽少（<1%基础模型），但推理时会产生高达2.5倍的显著延迟，需要解决方案。

Method: 采用零延迟融合低秩适配器技术，将适配器参数无缝集成到基础模型中。

Result: 在1B/3B/7B模型上，zFLoRA在18个任务中表现优于LoRA和全微调，在NPU/GPU上实现零延迟开销。

Conclusion: zFLoRA有效解决了适配器推理延迟问题，为多下游应用部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with task-specific
adapters catering to multiple downstream applications. In such a scenario, the
additional compute associated with these apparently insignificant number of
adapter parameters (typically less than 1% of the base model) turns out to be
disproportionately significant during inference time (upto 2.5x times that of
the base model). In this paper, we propose a new zero-latency fused low-rank
adapter (zFLoRA) that introduces zero or negligible latency overhead on top of
the base model. Experimental results on LLMs of size 1B, 3B and 7B show that
zFLoRA compares favorably against the popular supervised fine-tuning benchmarks
including low-rank adapters (LoRA) as well as full fine-tuning (FFT).
Experiments are conducted on 18 different tasks across three different
categories namely commonsense reasoning, math reasoning and summary-dialogue.
Latency measurements made on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) as well as GPU (NVIDIA
H100) platforms show that the proposed zFLoRA adapters introduce zero to
negligible latency overhead.

TL;DR: LISTEN 框架使用LLM作为零样本偏好预言机，通过自然语言指导专家在复杂多目标决策中做出选择，提出了LISTEN-U（参数化效用函数）和LISTEN-T（非参数化锦标赛选择）两种算法。


<details>

Motivation: 人类专家在面临多目标决策时难以形式化复杂隐含偏好，传统偏好获取方法认知负担重。需要一种能直接用自然语言指导决策的解决方案。

Method: 提出LISTEN框架，使用LLM作为偏好预言机。开发两种迭代算法：LISTEN-U（基于参数化效用函数优化）和LISTEN-T（基于非参数化锦标赛选择）。引入一致性指标衡量偏好参数化对齐程度。

Result: 在航班预订、购物、考试安排等任务上的实验表明：当偏好参数化对齐时LISTEN-U表现优异，而LISTEN-T在更广泛场景下具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LISTEN展示了用自然语言直接指导复杂多目标决策的可行性，有效降低了传统偏好获取的认知负担，为LLM在决策支持领域的应用开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Human experts often struggle to select the best option from a large set of
items with multiple competing objectives, a process bottlenecked by the
difficulty of formalizing complex, implicit preferences. To address this, we
introduce LISTEN, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as a
zero-shot preference oracle, guided only by an expert's high-level priorities
in natural language. To operate within LLM constraints like context windows and
inference costs, we propose two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U, which uses the
LLM to refine a parametric utility function, and LISTEN-T, a non-parametric
method that performs tournament-style selections over small batches of
solutions. Evaluated on diverse tasks including flight booking, shopping, and
exam scheduling, our results show LISTEN-U excels when preferences are
parametrically aligned (a property we measure with a novel concordance metric),
while LISTEN-T offers more robust performance. This work explores a promising
direction for steering complex multi-objective decisions directly with natural
language, reducing the cognitive burden of traditional preference elicitation.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的长文本数据中大部分缺乏有意义的长距离依赖，使用这些数据训练模型效率低下，因此需要精心筛选数据以提升长上下文语言模型的性能。

Method: LongFilter通过对比模型在长上下文和短上下文设置下的预测差异，衡量扩展上下文带来的信息增益，从而筛选出长距离依赖至关重要的训练样本。

Result: 在LLaMA-3-8B模型上进行实验，将其上下文长度从8K扩展到64K，LongFilter能够高效选择高质量数据，在HELMET、LongBench和RULER等基准测试上取得显著提升。

Conclusion: LongFilter框架能有效识别和筛选具有重要长距离依赖的训练数据，显著提升长上下文语言模型的训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Long-context language models unlock advanced capabilities in reasoning, code
generation, and document summarization by leveraging dependencies across
extended spans of text. However, a significant portion of readily available
long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies; most spans can be
predicted using only local context. Training on such data is inefficient,
making careful data selection crucial. Therefore, we introduce LongFilter, a
framework for curating training data tailored to long-context pretraining.
LongFilter measures the information gain provided by extended context by
contrasting model predictions under long-context versus short-context settings,
thereby identifying samples where long-range dependencies are essential.
Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B, extending its context length from 8K to 64K, show
that LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial
improvements on benchmarks such as HELMET, LongBench, and RULER.

TL;DR: 研究表明LLM的角色扮演会引入意识形态偏见，角色越相似，一致性越强，跨阵营分歧越大，引发AI系统表面中立实则强化党派观点的担忧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保内容审核系统中使用的LLM的公平性和中立性，研究角色设定如何影响不同模型架构、规模和多模态内容的有害内容分类一致性和公平性。

Method: 分析不同意识形态倾向的角色对有害内容分类的影响，通过一致性分析和针对政治敏感任务的额外研究，考察模型行为变化和意识形态对齐程度。

Result: 表面指标显示角色对分类准确性影响不大，但深入分析发现角色导致行为变化：不同意识形态角色对有害内容的判定倾向不同；大模型更倾向于与同意识形态角色保持一致，加强内部一致性同时加大跨意识形态分歧；角色在政治任务中表现出防御自身观点、淡化对立观点危害性的倾向。

Conclusion: 角色设定会在LLM输出中引入微妙的意识形态偏见，使用可能伪装中立的AI系统存在强化党派观点的风险，需引起重视。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in content moderation
systems, where ensuring fairness and neutrality is essential. In this study, we
examine how persona adoption influences the consistency and fairness of harmful
content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and
content modalities (language vs. vision). At first glance, headline performance
metrics suggest that personas have little impact on overall classification
accuracy. However, a closer analysis reveals important behavioral shifts.
Personas with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to
label content as harmful, showing that the lens through which a model "views"
input can subtly shape its judgments. Further agreement analyses highlight that
models, particularly larger ones, tend to align more closely with personas from
the same political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while
widening divergence across ideological groups. To show this effect more
directly, we conducted an additional study on a politically targeted task,
which confirmed that personas not only behave more coherently within their own
ideology but also exhibit a tendency to defend their perspective while
downplaying harmfulness in opposing views. Together, these findings highlight
how persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM
outputs, raising concerns about the use of AI systems that may reinforce
partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统向量数据库方法在处理FHIR DocumentReference资源中的临床文档时，往往难以捕捉细微的临床关系，导致语义问答效果不佳。

Method: 开发了CLEAR方法，采用实体感知检索技术，并建立了临床笔记问答评估平台，与零样本大上下文推理和传统分块检索增强生成方法进行比较。

Result: CLEAR方法在12份临床笔记测试中获得58.3%的胜率，平均语义相似度0.878，token使用量减少78%。在超过65,000 token的长文档上胜率达到75%。

Conclusion: 实体感知检索显著提高了临床自然语言处理的效率和准确性，该评估框架为临床问答系统提供了可重用且透明的基准测试平台。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) store clinical documentation as base64
encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources, which makes semantic
question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss
nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR)
method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and
achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for
embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We
developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against
zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval
augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from
10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a
58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78
percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance
gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents
exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval
improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing.
The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for
assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and
computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for unlocking their
task generalization potential and domain-specific capabilities. However, the
current LLM post-training paradigm faces significant data challenges, including
the high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data
scales. Therefore, achieving data-efficient post-training has become a key
research question. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey of
data-efficient LLM post-training from a data-centric perspective. We propose a
taxonomy of data-efficient LLM post-training methods, covering data selection,
data quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation and
compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems. We summarize representative
approaches in each category and outline future research directions. By
examining the challenges in data-efficient LLM post-training, we highlight open
problems and propose potential research avenues. We hope our work inspires
further exploration into maximizing the potential of data utilization in
large-scale model training. Paper List:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了使用LLM进行FrameNet语义标注的（半）自动化方法，通过与手动标注对比，发现半自动方法在框架多样性上表现更好，而纯自动方法在所有指标上都较差（除了标注时间）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于LLM的工具在语言资源创建中具有加速和替代人工劳动的潜力，但对其在标注数据集创建中的性能和影响，尤其是在视角化NLP方法下的全面评估仍然缺乏。

Method: 通过比较三种实验设置（手动、自动和半自动标注）下的标注时间、覆盖范围和多样性，评估LLM-based语义角色标注器的性能。

Result: 混合半自动标注设置相比纯人工设置提高了框架多样性并保持相似的标注覆盖范围，而纯自动设置在除标注时间外的所有指标上都表现明显较差。

Conclusion: 半自动标注方法在提高框架多样性的同时保持了标注覆盖范围，显示出在语义标注任务中的潜力，而纯自动方法仍需改进。

Abstract: The use of LLM-based applications as a means to accelerate and/or substitute
human labor in the creation of language resources and dataset is a reality.
Nonetheless, despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research,
comprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of
annotated datasets, especially under a perspectivized approach to NLP, is still
missing. This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an
extensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic
annotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology
employed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental
settings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation. Results show that
the hybrid, semi-automatic annotation setting leads to increased frame
diversity and similar annotation coverage, when compared to the human-only
setting, while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all
metrics, except for annotation time.

*André V. Duarte,Xuying li,Bin Zeng,Arlindo L. Oliveira,Lei Li,Zhuo Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RECAP是一种代理式管道，通过反馈驱动的循环从大型语言模型中提取和验证训练数据中的记忆内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于无法直接检查LLM的训练数据，需要一种方法来验证模型是否记忆了特定内容，最有力的证据是模型能够自由重现目标内容。

Method: RECAP采用反馈驱动循环：初次提取尝试由次级语言模型评估，与原文档对比识别差异，生成修正提示指导目标模型后续生成；同时包含越狱模块应对对齐导致的拒绝。

Result: 在EchoTrace基准测试（涵盖30多本书）上，RECAP相比单次迭代方法显著提升。GPT-4.1提取受版权文本的ROUGE-L得分从0.38提高到0.47，提升近24%。

Conclusion: RECAP有效解决了从对齐的LLM中提取记忆训练数据的问题，通过迭代修正显著提升了提取质量。

Abstract: If we cannot inspect the training data of a large language model (LLM), how
can we ever know what it has seen? We believe the most compelling evidence
arises when the model itself freely reproduces the target content. As such, we
propose RECAP, an agentic pipeline designed to elicit and verify memorized
training data from LLM outputs. At the heart of RECAP is a feedback-driven
loop, where an initial extraction attempt is evaluated by a secondary language
model, which compares the output against a reference passage and identifies
discrepancies. These are then translated into minimal correction hints, which
are fed back into the target model to guide subsequent generations. In
addition, to address alignment-induced refusals, RECAP includes a jailbreaking
module that detects and overcomes such barriers. We evaluate RECAP on
EchoTrace, a new benchmark spanning over 30 full books, and the results show
that RECAP leads to substantial gains over single-iteration approaches. For
instance, with GPT-4.1, the average ROUGE-L score for the copyrighted text
extraction improved from 0.38 to 0.47 - a nearly 24% increase.

*Negar Foroutan,Paul Teiletche,Ayush Kumar Tarun,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过训练不同参数规模的多语言大语言模型，挑战了多语言训练中关于语言数量与性能平衡的传统观点，发现适当平衡的多语言数据可以提升模型能力且不影响性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨不同多语言数据混合对预训练大语言模型的影响，特别是关于语言覆盖与模型性能之间权衡（即"多语言诅咒"）的争议假设。

Method: 训练了1.1B和3B参数的大语言模型，使用不同语言数量的多语言语料库（25到400种语言），研究英语作为枢纽语言的作用以及语言家族内选择枢纽语言的效果。

Result: 研究发现：1）当语言在预训练语料中有足够token时，英语和多语言数据结合不会降低任一语言的性能；2）英语作为枢纽语言对所有语系都有益，特定语系内选择枢纽语言并未一致提升该语系语言性能；3）在此规模模型中没有观察到明显的"多语言诅咒"现象。

Conclusion: 适当平衡的多语言数据可以增强语言模型能力而不损害性能，即使在低资源环境下也适用。

Abstract: The impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large
language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate, often raising
concerns about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model
performance (i.e., the curse of multilinguality). In this work, we investigate
these assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse
multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study
challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find
that combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the
in-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a
sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we
observe that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language
that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits
across language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot
language from within a specific family does not consistently improve
performance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a
significant "curse of multilinguality" as the number of training languages
increases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data,
when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without
compromising performance, even in low-resource settings

*Mohsinul Kabir,Tasnim Ahmed,Md Mezbaur Rahman,Polydoros Giannouris,Sophia Ananiadou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究揭示了机器翻译中文化差异对语义标签保真的影响，特别是LLMs会编码文化知识从而加剧标签漂移，文化相似性是保持标签一致性的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探讨机器翻译中文化对齐的作用，发现现有研究忽视了文化差异对语义标签保真的影响，特别是在低资源语言翻译中文化因素可能导致标签漂移和误译。

Method: 通过在不同文化敏感领域和中性领域进行系列实验，比较统计机器翻译工具和现代大型语言模型在翻译过程中的标签漂移情况，分析文化相似性对标签保存的影响。

Result: 发现三个关键结果：1）MT系统（包括LLMs）在翻译中会引起标签漂移，尤其在文化敏感领域；2）LLMs编码文化知识会放大标签漂移；3）源语言和目标语言的文化相似性是标签保存的关键决定因素。

Conclusion: 研究强调在机器翻译中忽视文化因素不仅会削弱标签保真度，还会导致下游应用中的误解和文化冲突，建议在MT系统中充分考虑文化对齐因素。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) is widely employed to address resource scarcity in
low-resource languages by generating synthetic data from high-resource
counterparts. While sentiment preservation in translation has long been
studied, a critical but underexplored factor is the role of cultural alignment
between source and target languages. In this paper, we hypothesize that
semantic labels are drifted or altered during MT due to cultural divergence.
Through a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral
domains, we establish three key findings: (1) MT systems, including modern
Large Language Models (LLMs), induce label drift during translation,
particularly in culturally sensitive domains; (2) unlike earlier statistical MT
tools, LLMs encode cultural knowledge, and leveraging this knowledge can
amplify label drift; and (3) cultural similarity or dissimilarity between
source and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation. Our
findings highlight that neglecting cultural factors in MT not only undermines
label fidelity but also risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in
downstream applications.

TL;DR: SymCode是一个神经符号框架，通过将数学问题解决重构为可验证的代码生成任务，利用SymPy库提高大型语言模型在复杂数学推理中的准确性和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂数学推理中表现不佳，基于文本的生成导致未经验证和算术不健全的解决方案。现有的提示策略如思维链仍在这种不可靠的媒介中操作，缺乏确定性验证机制。

Method: 引入SymCode神经符号框架，将数学问题解决重构为使用SymPy库的可验证代码生成任务，将LLM推理建立在确定性符号引擎基础上。

Result: 在MATH-500和OlympiadBench等挑战性基准测试中，相比基线方法准确率提升高达13.6个百分点，同时更加令牌高效，并将模型失败从模糊的逻辑谬误转向透明的程序化错误。

Conclusion: SymCode通过在确定性符号引擎基础上建立LLM推理，代表了在形式化领域实现更准确和可信AI的关键一步。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, where prose-based generation leads to unverified and arithmetically
unsound solutions. Current prompting strategies like Chain of Thought still
operate within this unreliable medium, lacking a mechanism for deterministic
verification. To address these limitations, we introduce SymCode, a
neurosymbolic framework that reframes mathematical problem-solving as a task of
verifiable code generation using the SymPy library. We evaluate SymCode on
challenging benchmarks, including MATH-500 and OlympiadBench, demonstrating
significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over
baselines. Our analysis shows that SymCode is not only more token-efficient but
also fundamentally shifts model failures from opaque logical fallacies towards
transparent, programmatic errors. By grounding LLM reasoning in a deterministic
symbolic engine, SymCode represents a key step towards more accurate and
trustworthy AI in formal domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文针对AWS Trainium AI加速器，设计了高性能矩阵乘法实现，通过定制化的内核融合和缓存策略，显著提升了LLM推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AWS Trainium虽为AI工作负载提供高性能解决方案，但其脉动阵列架构和数据布局特殊要求使得实现高性能具有挑战性。矩阵乘法作为LLM推理的关键计算内核，需要针对Trainium架构进行专门优化。

Method: 基于内核融合和新型缓存策略，设计了一系列针对Trainium的定制化技术，减少软件管理内存层次中的数据移动，最大化SRAM带宽，并避免昂贵的矩阵转置操作。

Result: 在9个数据集和4个最新LLM上的评估显示，该方法在矩阵乘法内核层面平均实现1.35倍（最高2.22倍）加速，在端到端LLM推理中平均实现1.66倍（最高2.49倍）加速，大幅优于AWS实现。

Conclusion: 研究成果证明了针对Trainium架构的专用优化技术能有效提升矩阵乘法性能和LLM推理效率，为AI加速器的高效利用提供了有价值的解决方案。

Abstract: AI accelerators, customized to AI workloads, provide cost-effective and
high-performance solutions for training and inference. Trainium, an AI
accelerator recently developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides an
attractive option for LLM training and inference through its heterogeneous
architecture. However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance
can be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special
requirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix
multiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on
Trainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on
kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the
software-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive
matrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show
that our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by
AWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x
speedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to
2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.

TL;DR: AttnCache - 通过缓存和重用相似注意力图谱来加速LLM预填充阶段推理的框架，在CPU和GPU上分别实现1.2x-1.6x端到端加速和2x-3x注意力计算加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多真实工作负载只使用LLM的预填充阶段，但自注意力计算的二次复杂度成为性能瓶颈。研究发现语义不同的句子在不同层和头之间常产生相似的注意力图谱

Method: 基于注意力图谱记忆数据库，采用高效缓存和相似性搜索技术，在推理时识别并重用预先缓存的注意力图谱来减少自注意力计算开销

Result: 在CPU上实现平均1.2x端到端加速和2x注意力加速，在GPU上实现1.6x端到端加速和3x注意力加速，精度损失可忽略

Conclusion: AttnCache框架有效解决了LLM预填充阶段的性能瓶颈，通过重用相似注意力图谱显著提升推理效率，为实际应用提供了可行的加速方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such
as chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads
such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding
rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input
sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only
scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance
bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In
this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce
similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we
propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM
inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an
attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and
similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps
during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of
self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of
1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x
attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了监督强化学习（SRL）框架，通过将问题解决重新定义为生成逻辑“动作”序列，结合专家演示的监督奖励机制，解决了小型开源语言模型在需要多步推理的任务中遇到的困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（尤其是小型开源模型）在处理需要多步推理的问题时表现不佳。监督微调（SFT）容易导致对长演示的严格逐词模仿而过度拟合，而带可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）在正确解决方案稀少的情况下难以有效采样。

Method: 提出监督强化学习（SRL）框架：1）将问题解决重新定义为生成逻辑“动作”序列；2）训练模型在提交每个动作前生成内部推理独白；3）基于模型动作与从SFT数据集中提取的专家动作之间的相似性，提供逐步的平滑奖励。

Result: SRL使小型模型能够学习SFT或RLVR之前无法学习的具有挑战性的问题。此外，在RLVR细化之前使用SRL初始化训练可获得最强的整体性能。SRL还能有效推广到智能软件工程任务。

Conclusion: SRL是一个稳健且多功能的面向推理的LLM训练框架，通过结合专家监督和强化学习，显著提升了小型模型在多步推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require
multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely
sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to
overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address
this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that
reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical "actions". SRL
trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing
to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between
the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a
step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all
rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert
demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging
problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training
with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance.
Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software
engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework
for reasoning-oriented LLMs.

TL;DR: PORTool采用强化学习方法训练LLM探索多种工具调用轨迹，通过树状结构生成多个解决方案路径，基于步骤奖励和相对优势来优化模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具使用LLM在静态数据集上训练，只能模仿通用工具调用流程，无法在动态环境中探索多种解决方案，导致性能受限。

Method: PORTool使用RL方法：1）为查询生成多个工具调用轨迹形成树状结构；2）基于成功率和正确性分配步骤奖励；3）结合分叉相对优势和轨迹相对优势训练LLM。

Result: 实验使用17个工具处理用户查询，PORTool在最终准确率和工具调用步骤数上相比其他训练方法有显著提升。消融研究验证了步骤奖励设计的必要性。

Conclusion: PORTool通过强化学习探索多种工具使用轨迹，有效提升了LLM在动态工具调用环境中的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Current tool-use large language models (LLMs) are trained on static datasets,
enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multi-step,
tool-integrated reasoning, which produces tool-call trajectories. However,
these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine,
thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited
performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we
propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a
tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer.
Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given
query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a
tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability
to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step
across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps
under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards
are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with
trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments
utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and
time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify
the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we
compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate
significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.

TL;DR: 论文系统分析了跨语言对齐的权衡，提出了评估文化冲突的框架，发现现有方法以牺牲文化本地化为代价提升事实转移，并提出了基于层级解耦的外科手术式调控方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是识别跨语言对齐方法引发的"文化擦除"问题，即追求多语言表征统一可能导致失去对文化背景敏感的回答能力，需要平衡知识转移与文化本地化之间的冲突。

Method: 提出了转移-本地化评估平面框架，系统性分析CLA方法的权衡效应，并通过内部表征分析发现事实转移与文化知识在不同层级可分离，据此提出Surgical Steering推理时调控方法。

Result: 评估显示现有CLA方法在六种语言中都一致改善了事实转移但直接损害了文化本地化，而提出的新方法通过在特定层级进行针对性激活调控，实现了二者更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 跨语言对齐需考虑文化特异性，层级解耦调控是有效平衡知识转移与文化保存的关键技术路径，为多语言模型的文化适应性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Cross-lingual alignment (CLA) aims to align multilingual representations,
enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to seamlessly transfer knowledge across
languages. While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational
convergence can inadvertently cause "cultural erasure", the functional loss of
providing culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query
language. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing
a holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which
quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.
Using this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they
consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural
localization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the
internal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal
factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at
different model layers. Based on this finding, we propose Surgical Steering, a
novel inference-time method that disentangles these two objectives. By applying
targeted activation steering to distinct layers, our approach achieves a better
balance between the two competing dimensions, effectively overcoming the
limitations of current alignment techniques.

Motivation: 随着影像检查的普及，意外甲状腺发现日益增多，但其流行情况、特征和临床影响仍不明确。

Method: 回顾性队列研究，使用基于transformer的NLP流程自动识别放射报告中的ITFs并提取结节特征。

Result: 在115,683名患者中，7.8%发现ITFs，其中92.9%为结节。ITFs患者更可能接受超声、活检、甲状腺切除术和甲状腺癌诊断。

Conclusion: ITFs常见且与甲状腺癌过度诊断相关，需标准化报告和更有选择性的随访策略。

Abstract: Importance Incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) are increasingly detected on
imaging performed for non-thyroid indications. Their prevalence, features, and
clinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and
deploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in
radiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes.
Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior
thyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from
July 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline
identified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from
multiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of
ITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer
diagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related
factors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%
women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more
likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was
ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were
more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule
characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other
features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients
without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,
biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were
papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were
common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,
low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer
overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective
follow-up.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been applied to automatic
programming code generation. This task can be viewed as a language generation
task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic.
However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with
hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python
code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce
QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum
programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers
two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator
environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of
domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error
classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it
incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming
contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of
LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even
advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting
the difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3
reach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written
codes (39.98%). We release the QCoder Benchmark dataset and public evaluation
API to support further research.

TL;DR: 提出1PNS（一个问题多个解决方案）训练范式和RPD（推理路径差异）指标，通过提高推理多样性增强测试时间扩展效果，在Qwen3-4B-Base上验证有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统1P1S（一个问题一个解决方案）训练导致的模型输出多样性不足问题，这种局限性会阻碍测试时间扩展（TTS）的效果。

Method: 引入RPD指标量化多步思维链的语义差异，用RPD筛选最大多样性的解决方案集，对Qwen3-4B-Base进行1PNS微调。

Result: 实验显示RPD选择的训练数据能产生更多样输出和更高pass@k，pass@16平均提升2.80%，在AIME24上提升4.99%。

Conclusion: 1PNS训练范式能有效放大TTS的效果，通过提高推理路径多样性显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often
becomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common "one problem, one
solution" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer
and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we
propose a "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training paradigm that
exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus
increases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring
semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce
Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores
Long Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate
reasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and
fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields
more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16
over a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that
1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 使用LLM和提示工程研究说服技术与话语关系之间的联系，创建了包含PTs和DRs的银标注数据集，发现六种话语关系在说服性文本中起关键作用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏同时标注说服技术和话语关系的数据，需要探索两者之间的关联以帮助检测网络宣传和错误信息

Method: 以SemEval 2023 Task 3数据集为基础，使用4个LLM和10种提示创建40个DR分类器，通过多数投票策略构建5个银标注数据集

Result: 统计分析发现6种话语关系在说服文本中起关键作用，特别是在特定说服技术中，创建的银数据集规模从204到1281实例不等

Conclusion: 研究揭示了话语关系在说服性沟通中的重要角色，有助于网络宣传检测和对有效沟通机制的理解

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between Persuasion Techniques (PTs)
and Discourse Relations (DRs) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and
prompt engineering. Since no dataset annotated with both PTs and DRs exists, we
took the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset labelled with 19 PTs as a starting point
and developed LLM-based classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with
one of the 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs. In total, four LLMs were evaluated using 10
different prompts, resulting in 40 unique DR classifiers. Ensemble models using
different majority-pooling strategies were used to create 5 silver datasets of
instances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level-2 PDTB senses. The
silver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on
the majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver
datasets shows that six discourse relations (namely Cause, Purpose, Contrast,
Cause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) play a crucial role in persuasive
texts, especially in the use of Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation,
Repetition and to cast Doubt. This insight can contribute to detecting online
propaganda and misinformation, as well as to our general understanding of
effective communication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了MossNet，一种新颖的混合状态空间专家架构，用于模拟线性多头注意力机制。相比现有的SSM/GRM方法，MossNet通过时间混合SSM核实现多头注意力，在语言建模和下游任务中超越了同等规模的Transformer和SSM架构，并展示了良好的可扩展性和运行效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于SSM/GRM的方法通常只模拟单个注意力头，限制了模型的表达能力。作者希望通过混合专家机制实现多头注意力，提高状态空间模型的表达能力和性能。

Method: MossNet采用混合状态空间专家架构，不仅在通道混合MLP块中应用MoE，还在时间混合SSM核中实现多个'注意力头'，从而模拟线性多头注意力机制。

Result: 在语言建模和下游评估中，MossNet在同等模型大小和数据预算下优于Transformer和SSM架构。大规模版本在万亿token上训练进一步证实了其可扩展性和优越性能。在三星Galaxy S24 Ultra和Nvidia A100 GPU上的实际设备性能分析显示其具有更优的运行速度和资源使用效率。

Conclusion: MossNet为高效、高性能的循环LLM架构提供了一个有前景的新方向，证明了通过混合专家机制实现多头注意力的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced generative
applications in natural language processing (NLP). Recent trends in model
architectures revolve around efficient variants of transformers or
state-space/gated-recurrent models (SSMs, GRMs). However, prevailing
SSM/GRM-based methods often emulate only a single attention head, potentially
limiting their expressiveness. In this work, we propose MossNet, a novel
mixture-of-state-space-experts architecture that emulates a linear multi-head
attention (MHA). MossNet leverages a mixture-of-experts (MoE) implementation
not only in channel-mixing multi-layered perceptron (MLP) blocks but also in
the time-mixing SSM kernels to realize multiple "attention heads." Extensive
experiments on language modeling and downstream evaluations show that MossNet
outperforms both transformer- and SSM-based architectures of similar model size
and data budgets. Larger variants of MossNet, trained on trillions of tokens,
further confirm its scalability and superior performance. In addition,
real-device profiling on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and an Nvidia A100 GPU
demonstrate favorable runtime speed and resource usage compared to similarly
sized baselines. Our results suggest that MossNet is a compelling new direction
for efficient, high-performing recurrent LLM architectures.

TL;DR: SDM语言模型通过引入相似性-距离-幅值激活层和对比输入编码方案，减少生成过程中的弃权行为，提高统计效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有语言模型在指令跟随任务中生成概率分布校准不佳的问题，通过设计SDM激活层来划分高概率区域，提升模型对指令的响应质量。

Method: 1. 在预训练的仅解码器Transformer模型上添加SDM激活层；2. 使用监督微调，结合对比输入编码方案；3. 在线生成硬负例优化损失函数。

Result: SDM模型相比强监督基线减少了弃权行为，表现出更高的统计效率。

Conclusion: SDM框架能够有效提升语言模型的指令跟随能力，且该方法可广泛应用于现有预训练模型的微调过程中。

Abstract: We introduce Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) language models (LMs), which
are sequence prediction models fine-tuned to maximize the proportion of
generations in the well-calibrated, high-probability region partitioned by a
final-layer SDM activation layer used for binary classification of
instruction-following. We demonstrate that existing pre-trained decoder-only
Transformer LMs can be readily converted into SDM LMs via supervised
fine-tuning, using the final-layer SDM activation layer during training to
estimate a change-of-base for a supervised next-token loss over a contrastive
input encoding scheme, with additional hard negative examples generated online
during training. This results in reduced abstentions (i.e., improved
statistical efficiency) compared to strong supervised baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RCScore是一个评估大语言模型指令鲁棒性的多维框架，发现不同指令风格可能导致准确率变化高达16.7%，并提出了交叉响应相似性(CRS)作为模型可靠性的代理指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估通常依赖单一指令模板，忽略了模型对指令风格的敏感性，这对实际部署至关重要。

Method: 通过系统地将基准问题转化为多种指令风格，使用RCScore量化指令表述对模型响应的影响，并引入CRS方法测量风格自一致性。

Result: 在四个推理基准上的十个LLM实验显示，指令风格变化可使准确率偏移达16.7%；确定性解码产生更稳定的输出；模型规模与跨风格一致性正相关。

Conclusion: RCScore为评估指令鲁棒性提供了原则性方法，一致性可以作为模型可靠性的有价值代理指标。

Abstract: Current LLM evaluations often rely on a single instruction template,
overlooking models' sensitivity to instruction style-a critical aspect for
real-world deployments. We present RCScore, a multi-dimensional framework
quantifying how instruction formulation affects model responses. By
systematically transforming benchmark problems into multiple instruction
styles, RCScore reveals performance variations undetected by conventional
metrics. Our experiments across ten LLMs on four reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7% points. We
introduce Cross-Response Similarity (CRS), a method applying RCScore metrics to
measure stylistic self-consistency, and establish its strong correlation with
task accuracy, suggesting consistency as a valuable proxy for model
reliability. Additional findings show that deterministic decoding produces more
stylistically stable outputs, and model scale correlates positively with
cross-style consistency. RCScore offers a principled approach to assess
instruction robustness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Token Timestep Allocation (TTA)方法，通过按token分配时间步来解决扩散语言模型中的更新遗忘问题，显著提升了可控性和流畅度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型在精细控制方面存在更新遗忘问题，即均匀且上下文无关的更新会导致token级别的波动，抹去先前的语义编辑并破坏累积精炼过程，从而降低流畅性和连贯性。

Method: 提出Token Timestep Allocation (TTA)方法，通过为每个token制定时间步调度来实现软语义排序：关键token早期冻结，不确定token持续精炼。该方法可作为固定策略或基于任务信号的自适应策略，纯推理时应用，适用于各种DLM和监督源。

Result: 在情感控制任务中，TTA将准确率提高20%以上，困惑度降低近一半，且步骤数减少至五分之一以下；在去毒化任务中，最大毒性从14.5降至12.2，困惑度从32.0降至26.0。

Conclusion: 通过时间步分配实现的软化排序是缓解更新遗忘、实现稳定可控扩散文本生成的关键机制。

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their
practical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally
characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform
and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,
erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement
process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in
uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token
ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and
semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are
frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This
timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an
adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of
refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies
uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision
sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment
control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves
perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers
maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).
Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep
allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving
stable and controllable diffusion text generation.

TL;DR: WIMHF方法使用稀疏自编码器来解释人类反馈数据，能够识别出人类偏好的少量可解释特征，这些特征能解释黑盒模型的大部分偏好预测信号，并揭示人类偏好的多样性和数据集背景的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人类反馈对语言模型产生不可预测和不良影响的问题，因为从业者缺乏对反馈数据编码内容的清晰理解。现有方法需要预先指定假设来研究特定属性（如长度或奉承），而自动提取相关特征仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 引入WIMHF方法，使用稀疏自编码器来解释反馈数据，表征数据集能够测量的偏好和注释者实际表达的偏好。在7个数据集上进行实验。

Result: WIMHF识别出少量可解释的人类偏好特征，这些特征占黑盒模型偏好预测信号的大部分。揭示了人类偏好的多样性，例如Reddit用户偏好非正式和笑话，而HH-RLHF和PRISM的注释者则不喜欢。还发现了潜在的不安全偏好，如LMArena用户倾向于反对拒绝（通常支持有毒内容）。学习到的特征可用于有效的数据筛选和细粒度个性化。

Conclusion: WIMHF为从业者提供了一种以人为中心的分析方法，以更好地理解和使用偏好数据。

Abstract: Human feedback can alter language models in unpredictable and undesirable
ways, as practitioners lack a clear understanding of what feedback data
encodes. While prior work studies preferences over certain attributes (e.g.,
length or sycophancy), automatically extracting relevant features without
pre-specifying hypotheses remains challenging. We introduce What's In My Human
Feedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders.
WIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring
and (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7
datasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that
account for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by
black-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,
and the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer
informality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.
WIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users
tend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned
features enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in
Arena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.
They also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment
dataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that
improve preference prediction. WIMHF provides a human-centered analysis method
for practitioners to better understand and use preference data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个专门评估全局RAG（检索增强生成）能力的基准GlobalQA，并开发了GlobalRAG框架来提升LLM在需要跨文档聚合分析任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG评估基准主要关注局部RAG（基于少量文档片段回答问题），但现实应用中很多任务需要全局RAG能力——聚合分析整个文档集合来获取语料层面的信息。现有方法在处理全局任务时表现不佳。

Method: 提出GlobalRAG框架：1）通过分块检索保持结构连贯性；2）使用LLM驱动的智能过滤器去除噪音文档；3）集成聚合模块进行精确符号计算。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-14B模型上，GlobalRAG达到6.63 F1分数，显著优于最强基线方法的1.51 F1分数。

Conclusion: GlobalQA基准揭示了现有RAG方法在全局任务上的局限性，而GlobalRAG框架通过多工具协作的方式有效提升了全局RAG性能，为解决跨文档信息聚合问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to
reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation
benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant
chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only
localized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world
applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --
which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document
collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, "What are the top 10
most cited papers in 2023?"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering
four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k
extraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and
baselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,
with the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these
challenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that
preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates
LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates
aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,
GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,
validating the effectiveness of our method.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确理解隐含含义对人类交流至关重要，语言模型也应具备此能力，但现有方法存在不足

Method: 将Gricean语用学和关联理论等语用学理论概述作为提示，引导语言模型进行分步推理得出最终解释

Result: 相比零样本链式思维基准，该方法在语用推理任务上提升达9.6%；仅提及理论名称在大型模型中也能带来1-3%提升

Conclusion: 将语用学理论作为提示是有效的上下文学习方法，能显著提升语言模型理解隐含含义的能力

Abstract: The ability to accurately interpret implied meanings plays a crucial role in
human communication and language use, and language models are also expected to
possess this capability. This study demonstrates that providing language models
with pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective in-context learning approach
for tasks to understand implied meanings. Specifically, we propose an approach
in which an overview of pragmatic theories, such as Gricean pragmatics and
Relevance Theory, is presented as a prompt to the language model, guiding it
through a step-by-step reasoning process to derive a final interpretation.
Experimental results showed that, compared to the baseline, which prompts
intermediate reasoning without presenting pragmatic theories (0-shot
Chain-of-Thought), our methods enabled language models to achieve up to 9.6\%
higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we show that even
without explaining the details of pragmatic theories, merely mentioning their
names in the prompt leads to a certain performance improvement (around 1-3%) in
larger models compared to the baseline.

Motivation: 在双语社区中，主导语言持续影响少数民族语言的词汇系统，研究预训练语言模型是否具备识别借词的能力。

Method: 评估多种预训练语言模型在10种语言中区分借词和本族词汇的性能，使用明确的指令和上下文信息进行测试。

Result: 尽管提供了明确的指令和上下文信息，模型在区分借词和本族词汇方面表现较差，这证实了NLP系统存在偏向借词的偏见。

Conclusion: 研究结果对开发少数民族语言的NLP工具以及支持受主导语言词汇压力影响的语言保存工作具有重要启示。

Abstract: Throughout language history, words are borrowed from one language to another
and gradually become integrated into the recipient's lexicon. Speakers can
often differentiate these loanwords from native vocabulary, particularly in
bilingual communities where a dominant language continuously imposes lexical
items on a minority language. This paper investigates whether pretrained
language models, including large language models, possess similar capabilities
for loanword identification. We evaluate multiple models across 10 languages.
Despite explicit instructions and contextual information, our results show that
models perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones. These
findings corroborate previous evidence that modern NLP systems exhibit a bias
toward loanwords rather than native equivalents. Our work has implications for
developing NLP tools for minority languages and supporting language
preservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages.

Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在多语言场景下性能不均衡的问题，特别是在模型尺寸缩减时该问题被加剧。知识蒸馏在多语言环境中的应用尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 采用五种不同的知识蒸馏方法，在CLIP和SigLIP2模型上进行实验，评估这些方法在领域内检索和领域外视觉问答任务上的表现。

Result: 研究发现某些蒸馏配置在模型尺寸减半时仍能保持甚至提升多语言检索的鲁棒性，但其他方法无法维持跨任务稳定性，揭示了仅靠总体准确率无法反映的设计敏感权衡。

Conclusion: 多语言知识蒸馏存在复杂的设计权衡，需要在模型压缩过程中综合考虑跨语言表示一致性和下游任务性能，单纯依赖聚合准确率指标不足以评估蒸馏效果。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit uneven performance across languages, a
problem that is often exacerbated when the model size is reduced. While
Knowledge distillation (KD) demonstrates promising results in transferring
knowledge from larger to smaller VLMs, applying KD in multilingualism is an
underexplored area. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of KD
behavior across five distillation approaches, isolating their effects on
cross-lingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability
under model compression. We study five distillation formulations across CLIP
and SigLIP2, and evaluate them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual
QA. We find that some configurations preserve or even improve multilingual
retrieval robustness despite halving model size, but others fail to maintain
cross-task stability, exposing design-sensitive trade-offs that aggregate
accuracy alone does not reveal.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了NAD（神经元一致性解码）方法，通过分析LLM内部神经元激活模式而非外部输出来提升推理性能。该方法利用正确回答激活更少神经元且一致性更高的特性，实现无监督的候选答案选择，显著减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于外部输出（如概率、熵、自评估）的采样-评估-集成解码方法存在校准问题。作者发现内部神经元激活模式能提供更丰富、可靠的信息来区分正确和错误回答。

Method: 提出NAD方法，基于两个内部信号选择候选答案：1）神经元激活稀疏性（正确回答激活更少独特神经元）；2）跨样本神经元一致性（正确回答激活模式更一致）。该方法支持早期正确预测和激进提前停止。

Result: 在数学和科学基准上，NAD与多数投票效果相当；在开放式编码基准上，NAD持续优于Avg@64。通过早期剪枝不具希望的轨迹，NAD将token使用量减少99%且生成质量损失最小。

Conclusion: 内部信号为无标签集成解码提供了可靠、可扩展且高效的指导，神经元激活模式是比外部信号更优越的正确性指标。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly boost reasoning via
sample-evaluate-ensemble decoders, achieving label free gains without ground
truth. However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external
outputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these
signals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze
internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)
external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;
(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than
incorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct
responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones
diverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding
(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using
activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on
internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables
early correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports
aggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable
answers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where
majority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By
pruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with
minimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide
reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.

TL;DR: 这篇论文探讨了大型语言模型在处理数字信息时的内在机制，解释了为何尽管输入嵌入表示准确且相似，模型仍会在数字处理中产生错误输出。研究发现LLMs学会了系统性、高精度的数字表示方法，使得可以创建通用探针来追踪错误源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在数字处理中表现出的矛盾现象：一方面不同的LLMs对数字的输入嵌入表示趋于相似且准确，另一方面这些模型在处理数字信息时经常产生错误输出。研究旨在解释这种冲突并量化其机制的精确定下限。

Method: 通过探索语言模型如何操纵数字，分析不同LLMs在隐藏状态和各类输入上下文中的数字表示特性。创建通用探针对每个LLM进行测试，并将信息（包括输出错误的原因）追踪到特定层级。

Result: 研究发现尽管存在表面错误，但不同语言模型学会了可互换的、系统性、高精度且跨隐藏状态和输入上下文通用的数字表示。这使得能够为每个LLM创建通用探针，并将错误源精确定位到特定层。

Conclusion: 这项研究为理解预训练LLMs如何操作数字奠定了理论基础，并展示了更精确的探针技术在改进LLMs架构方面的潜力。研究结果表明可以通过特定层的干预来提升模型在数字处理方面的准确性。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that different large language models (LLMs) converge to
similar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers. These
findings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous
outputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain
this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify
the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite
surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable
representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal
across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to
create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the
causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental
understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the
potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs'
architectures.

enabling the model to analyze webpages, process user intents, and execute
cursor and keyboard inputs directly within the browser. While its capacity for
information retrieval tasks has been demonstrated, its performance in dynamic,
interactive environments remains less explored. In this study, we conduct an
early evaluation of Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser-based
games as test scenarios, including Google's T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird,
and Stein.world. We employ in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics
to assess performance across different task types. Our results show that Atlas
performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku, completing puzzles
significantly faster than human baselines, but struggles substantially in
real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control, often failing to
progress beyond initial obstacles. These findings suggest that while Atlas
demonstrates capable analytical processing, there remain notable limitations in
dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction. The website of our

TL;DR: SCRIBE是一个开源框架，使用小型语言模型解决教育场景中的个性化学生反馈问题，通过工具增强的多跳推理和迭代思考，在隐私保护和资源受限的环境中提供高质量反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在教育场景中应用语言模型提供个性化学生反馈面临三个关键挑战：隐私问题、有限的计算资源以及对教育学有效反馈的需求。现有的大模型不适合需要隐私保护和本地部署的真实教育应用。

Method: 开发了SCRIBE框架，结合领域特定工具和自反式推理管道，支持迭代推理、工具使用和错误恢复。通过两阶段LoRA微调在GPT-4o生成的数据上，训练出3B和8B规模的模型。

Result: 通过GPT-Judge评估和108名学生参与的用户研究显示，8B-SCRIBE模型在相关性和可操作性等关键维度上达到或超过更大模型的质量，被学生认为与GPT-4o和Llama-3.3 70B相当。

Conclusion: SCRIBE证明了在资源有限、对隐私敏感的教育应用中使用小型化模型的可行性，为教育技术提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Language models can be used to provide interactive, personalized student
feedback in educational settings. However, real-world deployment faces three
key challenges: privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and the need
for pedagogically valid responses. These constraints require small, open-source
models that can run locally and reliably ground their outputs in correct
information. We introduce SCRIBE, a framework for multi-hop, tool-augmented
reasoning designed to generate valid responses to student questions about
feedback reports. SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with a self-reflective
inference pipeline that supports iterative reasoning, tool use, and error
recovery. We distil these capabilities into 3B and 8B models via two-stage LoRA
fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data. Evaluation with a human-aligned
GPT-Judge and a user study with 108 students shows that 8B-SCRIBE models
achieve comparable or superior quality to much larger models in key dimensions
such as relevance and actionability, while being perceived on par with GPT-4o
and Llama-3.3 70B by students. These findings demonstrate the viability of
SCRIBE for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications.

TL;DR: ACER是一个自动课程增强框架，通过合成基于布鲁姆分类法的教材式训练数据，将通用LLM转化为领域专家，在保持通用能力的同时显著提升专业领域表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在经济学、心理学等专业领域表现欠佳的问题，这些领域需要深层的原理性理解，而通用模型存在关键的领域知识缺口。

Method: ACER首先生成专业的教材目录，基于布鲁姆分类法创建由浅入深的问答对，构建系统化训练语料；然后采用交错课程进度进行持续预训练，协调内容和认知维度的学习。

Result: 在Llama 3.2模型上，ACER在微观经济学等专业MMLU子集提升准确率5个百分点；所有目标领域平均提升3个百分点，并能实现正向跨领域知识迁移；在ARC和GPQA基准上提升超过2个百分点，同时保持通用推理能力稳定。

Conclusion: ACER提供了一种可扩展且有效的方法来缩小LLM在关键领域的知识差距，实现了专业能力提升与通用能力保持的平衡，证明了基于课程学习的专业化训练路径的可行性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general tasks but underperform in
specialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep,
principled understanding. To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated
Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain
experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a
comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for
a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's
taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing
difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining
with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content
and cognitive dimensions.
  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized
MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines
struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target
domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage
points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also
facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on
non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points,
while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing
critical domain gaps in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 健康相关的虚假信息普遍存在且有害，但特别当这些声称歪曲或误解科学发现时难以识别

Method: 提出MISynth pipeline，应用检索增强生成技术产生合成的谬误样本，然后用这些样本对LLM进行轻量级微调

Result: 微调后模型相比原始基准有显著准确率提升，LLaMA 3.1 8B模型在MISSCI测试集上F1分数绝对提升超过35%

Conclusion: 通过合成谬误数据增强有限的标注资源，即使计算资源有限也能显著提升LLM在真实世界科学虚假信息任务上的零样本分类性能

Abstract: Health-related misinformation is very prevalent and potentially harmful. It
is difficult to identify, especially when claims distort or misinterpret
scientific findings. We investigate the impact of synthetic data generation and
lightweight fine-tuning techniques on the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to recognize fallacious arguments using the MISSCI dataset and
framework. In this work, we propose MisSynth, a pipeline that applies
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples,
which are then used to fine-tune an LLM model. Our results show substantial
accuracy gains with fine-tuned models compared to vanilla baselines. For
instance, the LLaMA 3.1 8B fine-tuned model achieved an over 35% F1-score
absolute improvement on the MISSCI test split over its vanilla baseline. We
demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited
annotated resources can significantly enhance zero-shot LLM classification
performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited
computational resources. The code and synthetic dataset are available on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体LLM方法有潜力超越单一模型能力，但团队组合的优化面临挑战，因为大多数模型的不透明性掩盖了有效协作所需的内部特征。

Method: 构建语言模型图来映射模型间关系，通过分析两两对话的语义一致性来识别协同模型集群，然后应用社区检测方法确定功能协同的群组。

Result: 实验表明该方法能发现反映模型潜在专业化的功能连贯群组，通过特定话题引导的协同团队在下游基准测试中优于随机基线，达到与人工策划团队相当的准确率。

Conclusion: 该研究为自动设计协作型多智能体LLM团队提供了新的基础，证明了基于对话交互的团队组合方法的有效性。

Abstract: While a multi-agent approach based on large language models (LLMs) represents
a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models, its success
is critically dependent on synergistic team composition. However, forming
optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most
models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective
collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for
automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including
their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method
constructs a "language model graph" that maps relationships between models from
the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community
detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse
LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent
groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with
specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines
on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of
manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings
provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM
teams.

Method: 采用预训练语言模型和大语言模型方法进行科学文献语篇关系分类任务研究，重点分析语境（基于语篇结构定义）对分类任务的影响

Result: 实验表明基于语篇结构的语境在语篇关系分类任务中普遍有益，并分析了哪些科学语篇关系类型能从语境中获益最多

Conclusion: 语境在科学语篇关系分类中具有重要作用，为后续利用语篇信息支持AI生成科学声明的研究奠定了基础

Abstract: With the increasing use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to
support science workflows, we are interested in the use of discourse-level
information to find supporting evidence for AI generated scientific claims. A
first step towards this objective is to examine the task of inferring discourse
structure in scientific writing.
  In this work, we present a preliminary investigation of pretrained language
model (PLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) approaches for Discourse Relation
Classification (DRC), focusing on scientific publications, an under-studied
genre for this task. We examine how context can help with the DRC task, with
our experiments showing that context, as defined by discourse structure, is
generally helpful. We also present an analysis of which scientific discourse
relation types might benefit most from context.

TL;DR: OmniEduBench是一个包含24.6K个高质量问答对的中文教育基准测试，涵盖知识和素养两个维度，可全面评估LLM在教育领域的能力。在11个主流LLM上的实验显示现有模型仍有很大提升空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM基准大多只关注知识维度，忽视了教育场景中重要的素养能力评估，且缺乏多样性，特别是在中文教育环境下存在明显空白。

Method: 构建包含24,602个高质量问答对的综合性中文教育基准，分为知识维度(18,121项)和素养维度(6,481项)，覆盖61个学科和11种常见题型。在11个主流开源和闭源LLM上进行广泛实验。

Result: 知识维度中仅Gemini-2.5 Pro准确率超过60%；素养维度表现最好的QWQ模型仍落后人类智能近30%。实验结果揭示了LLM在教育应用中的显著挑战。

Conclusion: 该基准填补了中文教育评估的空白，实验结果表明LLM在教育领域仍有很大改进空间，突出了将LLM应用于教育场景的挑战。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), various LLM-based
works have been widely applied in educational fields. However, most existing
LLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely
neglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for
real-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often
limited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity.
This issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address
this gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational
benchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.
The data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge
dimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K
entries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained
categories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and
20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of
question formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid
foundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education.
Extensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs
reveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro
surpassed 60\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the
best-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\%.
These results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the
challenges of applying LLMs in education.

TL;DR: SSLC方法通过结合稀疏优化和低秩逼近技术，实现大语言模型的高效压缩，在LLaMA和Qwen2.5模型上取得最优效果，压缩50%无性能损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然有强大的语言理解和生成能力，但其巨大的带宽和计算需求限制了广泛应用。现有的剪枝和低秩逼近方法各有优势但协同效应未被充分探索。

Method: 提出协同稀疏和低秩压缩（SSLC）方法，基于理论分析将低秩逼近和稀疏优化统一为整体问题，通过迭代优化算法求解，无需额外训练步骤。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen2.5模型（7B-70B）上实验表明，SSLC始终优于单独方法，Qwen2.5压缩50%无性能下降，加速比至少1.63倍。

Conclusion: SSLC为高效部署大语言模型提供了实用解决方案，结合了两种压缩技术的优势，实现了性能保持的显著模型压缩。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
language comprehension and generation; however, their widespread adoption is
constrained by substantial bandwidth and computational demands. While pruning
and low-rank approximation have each demonstrated promising performance
individually, their synergy for LLMs remains underexplored. We introduce
\underline{S}ynergistic \underline{S}parse and \underline{L}ow-Rank
\underline{C}ompression (SSLC) methods for LLMs, which leverages the strengths
of both techniques: low-rank approximation compresses the model by retaining
its essential structure with minimal information loss, whereas sparse
optimization eliminates non-essential weights, preserving those crucial for
generalization. Based on theoretical analysis, we first formulate the low-rank
approximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem and solve it by
iterative optimization algorithm. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models
(7B-70B) show that SSLC, without any additional training steps, consistently
surpasses standalone methods, achieving state-of-the-arts results. Notably,
SSLC compresses Qwen2.5 by 50\% with no performance drop and achieves at least
1.63$\times$ speedup, offering a practical solution for efficient LLM
deployment.

Motivation: 当前领域特定的大语言模型存在缺乏透明度、微调成本高、需要大量提示工程、跨领域结果不一致以及高计算需求带来的环境影响等问题，需要一种更高效可靠的解决方案。

Method: 提出贝叶斯网络LLM融合框架，将FinBERT、RoBERTa和BERTweet三个LLM的情感预测作为概率节点，在贝叶斯网络中进行后期融合。

Result: 在三个具有不同语言和上下文特征的人工标注金融语料库上的评估显示，BNLF相比基线LLM实现了约6%的准确率一致性提升。

Conclusion: BNLF框架通过概率融合机制提高了情感分类的鲁棒性和可解释性，对数据集变异性具有强适应性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, with an increasing number
of domain-specific variants tailored for specialised tasks. However, these
models often lack transparency and explainability, can be costly to fine-tune,
require substantial prompt engineering, yield inconsistent results across
domains, and impose significant adverse environmental impact due to their high
computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Bayesian
network LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which integrates predictions from three
LLMs, including FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet, through a probabilistic
mechanism for sentiment analysis. BNLF performs late fusion by modelling the
sentiment predictions from multiple LLMs as probabilistic nodes within a
Bayesian network. Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora with
distinct linguistic and contextual characteristics, BNLF demonstrates
consistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline LLMs,
underscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of
probabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification.

Motivation: 旨在确定多个LLM代理的集成能否比单一LLM提供更可靠的对像素级AI分诊工具的评估。

Method: 分析29,766例非增强CT头部检查数据，使用8个开源LLM模型和GPT-4o的集成方法，通过多轮提示评估颅内出血（ICH）存在情况。

Result: Llama3.3:70b和GPT-4o表现最佳（AUC=0.78）。集成方法（Top-3、Full-9、Consensus）在MCC指标上优于单一GPT-4o（0.522），且集成方法间无显著差异。

Conclusion: 中大型开源LLM的集成提供了比单一LLM更一致可靠的方法，用于 retrospectively 评估临床AI分诊工具。

Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if an ensemble of
multiple LLM agents could be used collectively to provide a more reliable
assessment of a pixel-based AI triage tool than a single LLM.
  Methods: 29,766 non-contrast CT head exams from fourteen hospitals were
processed by a commercial intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) AI detection tool.
Radiology reports were analyzed by an ensemble of eight open-source LLM models
and a HIPAA compliant internal version of GPT-4o using a single multi-shot
prompt that assessed for presence of ICH. 1,726 examples were manually
reviewed. Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and
consensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were
tested for rating the performance of the triage tool.
  Results: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The
highest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78).
The average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76).
Llama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater
precision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the
ideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3
Ensemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522
(0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between
Top-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05).
  Conclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a
more consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective
evaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.

Motivation: 针对法律案件文档中存在的非结构化、词汇密集、指代模糊等问题，CORE-KG框架旨在解决现有LLM方法在知识图谱构建中产生的噪声和节点重复问题。

Method: 采用消融研究方法，分别移除CORE-KG框架中的共指消解模块和结构化提示，量化评估这两个组件对减少节点重复和噪声的影响。

Result: 移除共指消解导致节点重复增加28.32%，噪声节点增加4.32%；移除结构化提示导致节点重复增加4.34%，噪声节点增加73.33%。

Conclusion: 结构化提示对减少噪声节点更为关键，而共指消解对减少节点重复更重要，为设计鲁棒的LLM法律文本抽取管道提供了实证依据。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured,
lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose
significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While
recent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate
noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided
extraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework
addresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and
domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and
legal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to
quantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results
show that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node
duplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured
prompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in
noisy nodes. These findings offer empirical insights for designing robust
LLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex
legal texts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希伯来语标音恢复是确保单词准确发音和消除文本歧义的基础任务，尽管未加标音的希伯来语具有高度歧义性，但现有机器学习方法在该任务上仍有提升空间。

Method: 该方法将标音恢复视为零样本分类问题，在单词级别从动态生成的候选集中选择最合适的标音模式。关键创新是使用希伯来视觉语言模型，将未标音文本作为图像处理，使标音信息直接嵌入输入向量表示中。

Result: 在多种配置下的综合评估表明，该系统无需依赖复杂的显式语言分析即可有效执行标音恢复。在正确标音形式保证在候选集中的"oracle"设置下，DIVRIT实现了高准确率。

Conclusion: 战略性的架构增强和优化的训练方法显著提高了系统的泛化能力，这些发现凸显了视觉表示在准确自动希伯来语标音恢复方面的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate
word pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's
high degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches
have significantly advanced performance on this task.
  In this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization
that frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach
operates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization
pattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set,
conditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is
its use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text
as an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the
input's vector representation.
  Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we
demonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying
on complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting
where the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided
candidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic
architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield
significant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities.
These findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for
accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究扩展了线性关系解码器的分析，发现它们可被简化的三阶张量网络高度压缩，且这些解码器并非编码独立关系，而是提取重复的粗粒度语义属性，从而解释其压缩性和泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机在于深入理解Hernandez等人（2023）引入的线性操作符结构，将单关系发现扩展到多关系集合，并系统探索其组织方式，揭示关系解码的本质。

Method: 方法包括系统性地组织多关系集合，使用三阶张量网络进行压缩，并开发交叉评估协议来检验线性解码器在不同关系间的应用效果。

Result: 结果显示线性关系解码器可被高度压缩而不损失准确性；它们提取的是重复的粗粒度语义属性（如“国家属性”），而非独立关系，这解释了压缩性和泛化限制。

Conclusion: 结论是线性关系解码在Transformer语言模型中主要基于属性而非特定关系，这阐明了其压缩性和仅对语义相近新关系泛化的原因。

Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in
Hernandez et al. [2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer
language models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of
relations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such
collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3
tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this
surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we
apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our
results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but
extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital
city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This
property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and
highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically
close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer
language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在深度搜索场景中面临奖励密度低的挑战，代理需要大量探索成本却只能获得稀疏甚至为零的最终奖励，这阻碍了RLVR的实际应用

Method: InfoFlow框架包含三个核心方法：1)子问题分解：将长程任务分解并分配过程奖励；2)失败引导提示：向停滞轨迹注入纠正指导；3)双代理精炼：使用精炼代理压缩搜索历史，减轻认知负担

Conclusion: InfoFlow有效解决了深度搜索中的奖励稀疏问题，通过系统性优化奖励密度，提升了强化学习在复杂搜索任务中的实用性和效率

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for enhancing agentic deep search. However, its application is often hindered
by low \textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend
significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards. In
this paper, we formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Reward Density
Optimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of
exploration cost. This paper introduce \textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic
framework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \textbf{Subproblem
decomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards,
thereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \textbf{Failure-guided hints}:
injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the
probability of successful outcomes. 3) \textbf{Dual-agent refinement}:
employing a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep
exploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively
compresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration
cost and increasing the overall reward density. We evaluate InfoFlow on
multiple agentic search benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms strong
baselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to
advanced proprietary LLMs.

*Yinrong Hong,Zhiquan Tan,Kai Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CAST是一种新的动态树解码方法，通过考虑GPU配置和批量大小等推理成本来动态优化树结构，比传统解码方法快5.2倍，优于现有最先进技术5%-20%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLMs)面临自回归设计和庞大尺寸带来的推理延迟挑战，现有推测解码方法如EAGLE-2和EAGLE-3常忽视GPU设备和批量大小等关键系统变量的影响。

Method: 引入CAST动态树解码方法，综合考虑推理成本因素（包括GPU配置和批量大小），动态优化树结构以提高解码效率。

Result: 在6个不同任务和6个不同LLM上的综合实验显示，速度相比传统解码方法提升高达5.2倍，普遍优于现有最先进技术5%-20%。

Conclusion: CAST方法通过系统级优化显著提升了LLM推理效率，证明了考虑硬件配置和批量大小等实际推理成本对推测解码性能的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inference latency challenges
stemming from their autoregressive design and large size. To address this,
speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous
generation and validation of multiple tokens. While recent approaches like
EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures,
they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices
and batch sizes.
  Therefore, we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called CAST that
takes into account inference costs, including factors such as GPU
configurations and batch sizes, to dynamically refine the tree structure.
Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing
six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving
speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods. Moreover, it
generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques from 5% to 20%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SlideAgent是一个用于理解多模态、多页面、多布局文档的智能代理框架，通过三级分层推理（全局、页面、元素）构建结构化表示，在幻灯片文档理解方面显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前系统在处理复杂多页面视觉文档时表现不佳，特别是对文档元素和页面间的细粒度推理能力有限，而大语言模型为文档理解提供了新机会。

Method: 采用专门代理框架，将推理分解为三个层级：全局级、页面级和元素级，构建结构化、查询无关的表示，在推断时有选择地激活专门代理进行多层次推理。

Result: 广泛实验表明，SlideAgent相比专有模型整体提升7.9%，相比开源模型整体提升9.8%。

Conclusion: SlideAgent框架能有效处理复杂多页面视觉文档，通过分层代理推理机制在文档理解任务上取得显著改进。

Abstract: Multi-page visual documents such as manuals, brochures, presentations, and
posters convey key information through layout, colors, icons, and cross-slide
references. While large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities in document
understanding, current systems struggle with complex, multi-page visual
documents, particularly in fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages. We
introduce SlideAgent, a versatile agentic framework for understanding
multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, especially slide decks.
SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three
specialized levels-global, page, and element-to construct a structured,
query-agnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and
detailed visual or textual cues. During inference, SlideAgent selectively
activates specialized agents for multi-level reasoning and integrates their
outputs into coherent, context-aware answers. Extensive experiments show that
SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary (+7.9
overall) and open-source models (+9.8 overall).

*Biao Zhang,Yong Cheng,Siamak Shakeri,Xinyi Wang,Min Ma,Orhan Firat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文重新评估了编码器-解码器架构的LLM，发现配合现代训练方法后，该架构在多种任务上表现出与主流解码器架构相当甚至更优的性能，同时推理效率更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM研究快速转向解码器架构，但缺乏从扩展角度对编码器-解码器架构的严谨对比分析，可能忽视了该架构的潜力。

Method: 重新设计编码器-解码器LLM（RedLLM），采用前缀语言建模预训练，与使用因果语言建模的解码器LLM（DecLLM）在不同规模（1.5亿到80亿参数）上进行全面比较。

Result: RedLLM展现出强大的扩展性能和上下文长度外推能力；指令调优后在下游任务上表现相当甚至更优，同时推理效率显著更高。解码器LLM在预训练阶段计算效率更优。

Conclusion: 编码器-解码器架构具有被低估的潜力，值得进一步探索以开发更强大高效的LLM。

Abstract: Recent large language model (LLM) research has undergone an architectural
shift from encoder-decoder modeling to nowadays the dominant decoder-only
modeling. This rapid transition, however, comes without a rigorous comparative
analysis especially \textit{from the scaling perspective}, raising concerns
that the potential of encoder-decoder models may have been overlooked. To fill
this gap, we revisit encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM), enhancing it with recent
recipes from decoder-only LLM (DecLLM). We conduct a comprehensive comparison
between RedLLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling (LM), and DecLLM,
pretrained with causal LM, at different model scales, ranging from $\sim$150M
to $\sim$8B. Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN for
instruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compelling
scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overall
more compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling
and context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM
achieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while
enjoying substantially better inference efficiency. We hope our findings could
inspire more efforts on re-examining RedLLM, unlocking its potential for
developing powerful and efficient LLMs.

TL;DR: Evontree是一个利用少量高质量本体规则系统地从大型语言模型中提取、验证和增强领域知识的新框架，无需大量外部数据集即可实现低资源领域适应


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗等数据敏感领域，缺乏高质量领域特定训练语料限制了LLMs的专业应用，而领域专家已将领域智慧提炼成本体规则

Method: Evontree从原始模型中提取领域本体，使用两种核心本体规则检测不一致性，通过自蒸馏微调增强精炼后的知识

Result: 在医疗QA基准测试中，Evontree在Llama3-8B-Instruct和Med42-v2上始终优于未修改模型和领先的有监督基线，准确率提升最高达3.7%

Conclusion: 实验结果证实了该方法在低资源领域适应LLMs方面的有效性、效率和鲁棒性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities
across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated
fine-tuning data. However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the
lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation
for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain
wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and
ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as
implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel
framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to
systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs,
without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts
domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core
ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with
Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both
unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%
improvement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency,
and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Kimi Linear是一种混合线性注意力架构，首次在各种场景下公平比较中优于全注意力机制。它使用KDA(D)增强的线性注意力模块和专门的块式算法，在降低KV缓存75%的同时，实现6倍解码吞吐量，性能全面优于全注意力模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种能够在各种场景（短上下文、长上下文、强化学习）下都优于全注意力机制的线性注意力架构，解决现有线性注意力方法在性能和效率方面的局限性。

Method: 采用Kimi Delta Attention(KDA)模块扩展Gated DeltaNet，使用更细粒度的门控机制；设计专门的块式算法，采用Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank(DPLR)矩阵的专用变体；构建3B激活参数的混合模型，结合KDA和Multi-Head Latent Attention(MLA)。

Result: 在相同训练配方下，Kimi Linear在所有评估任务中都显著优于全MLA模型，将KV缓存使用量减少高达75%，在1M上下文场景下解码吞吐量提升6倍，并且在长输入输出任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: Kimi Linear可以作为全注意力架构的直接替代方案，提供更优的性能和效率，特别是在处理长序列任务时具有显著优势，标志着线性注意力模型的重要突破。

Abstract: We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for
the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across
various scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement
learning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an
expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a
finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited
finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware
efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)
transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the
general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical
delta rule.
  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total
parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention
(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear
outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while
reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding
throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be
a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior
performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output
lengths.
  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM
implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model
checkpoints.

*Zhichao Wang,Dongyang Ma,Xinting Huang,Deng Cai,Tian Lan,Jiahao Xu,Haitao Mi,Xiaoying Tang,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoDeco is a novel transformer architecture that enables truly end-to-end generation by learning context-specific decoding parameters (temperature and top-p) alongside next-token predictions, eliminating the need for manual hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs' 'end-to-end' label is misleading as they depend on non-differentiable decoding processes requiring laborious hand-tuning of hyperparameters like temperature and top-p, which limits their practical usability.

Method: Augment standard transformer with lightweight heads that dynamically predict context-specific temperature and top-p values at each step alongside next-token logits, transforming decoding into a parametric token-level process.

Result: AutoDeco significantly outperforms default decoding strategies and achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline across eight benchmarks, while demonstrating emergent capability for natural language instruction-based decoding control.

Conclusion: AutoDeco enables truly end-to-end generation with self-regulated sampling, opens a new paradigm for steerable and interactive LLM decoding through natural language commands, and provides practical improvements over static decoding methods.

Abstract: The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a
non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of
hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a
novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to
control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with
lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific
temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach
transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model
to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.
  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that
AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but
also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from
"hacking the test set"-a practical upper bound for any static method.
Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding
control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,
"generate with low randomness") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p
on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive
LLM decoding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究分析了在LLM后训练过程中价值对齐如何产生，发现监督微调阶段确立了价值对齐，而后续的偏好优化很少重新对齐这些价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在社会中作用日益重要，需要其不仅运用一般知识，还要与人类价值体系对齐。现有研究大多关注已训练模型的对齐评估，忽视了模型学习表达人类价值的训练动态。

Method: 实验使用Llama-3和Qwen-3不同规模的模型，结合流行的监督微调和偏好优化数据集与算法，使用合成偏好数据集进行受控操作，分析不同偏好优化算法对价值对齐的影响。

Result: 监督微调阶段一般确立了模型的价值对齐，后续偏好优化很少重新对齐这些价值，即使偏好数据保持不变，不同偏好优化算法也会导致不同的价值对齐结果。

Conclusion: 研究结果为后训练期间价值学习提供了可操作的见解，有助于指导数据策划、模型选择和偏好优化算法，以改进模型与人类价值对齐。

Abstract: As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and
more confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their
general knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems.
Therefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a
crucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the
alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which
models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at
which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's
post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training
algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts
during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different
sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization
datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a
model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these
values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables
controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference
optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when
preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into
how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,
as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization
to improve model alignment to human values.

TL;DR: 论文提出了 AMO-Bench，这是一个高难度的数学推理基准测试，包含50个人工设计的奥林匹克数学竞赛级别或更高难度的原创问题。实验表明，即使是表现最佳的模型在 AMO-Bench 上仅达到52.4%的准确率，揭示了当前LLMs在数学推理方面的巨大提升空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数学竞赛基准对顶级大语言模型评估效果下降，因为许多模型已达到性能饱和（如AIME24/25）。为了解决这个问题，作者创建了一个更具挑战性的基准。

Method: AMO-Bench包含50个经过专家交叉验证的原创问题，确保难度达到国际数学奥林匹克（IMO）标准，且仅需要最终答案而非证明，便于自动评分。

Result: 在26个大语言模型上的实验结果显示，即使最佳模型在 AMO-Bench 上的准确率也只有52.4%，大多数模型低于40%。进一步分析发现，测试时计算资源的增加显示出有希望的扩展趋势。

Conclusion: AMO-Bench突显了当前LLMs在数学推理方面仍有显著提升空间，该基准的发布旨在促进语言模型推理能力的进一步研究。

Abstract: We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with
Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems.
Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for
evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for
assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To
address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50
problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original
problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.
Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a
proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental
results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model
achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.
Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising
scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results
highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in
current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into
advancing the reasoning abilities of language models.

TL;DR: Gistify 是一项要求大型语言模型从代码库中提取核心功能，生成最小可执行文件的任务。现有模型在此类需要深度结构理解和长执行路径分析的任务上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着编码代理在大型代码库中的部署日益普遍，亟需设计能够自动评估其代码库级理解能力的挑战性任务。

Method: 提出 Gistify 任务：给定代码库和特定入口点，要求 LLM 生成一个最小化、自包含的文件来复现该功能。模型需分析代码结构、执行流程并生成可能较大的代码补丁。

Result: 研究发现当前最先进的模型难以可靠解决 Gistify 任务，特别是在处理长执行轨迹时表现明显不足。

Conclusion: Gistify 任务凸显了现有编码 LLM 在代码库级理解和执行流程建模方面的局限性，为未来模型改进提供了重要方向。

Abstract: As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, the need to
automatically design challenging, codebase-level evaluation is central. We
propose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal,
self-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase.
The coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specific
entrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate the
output of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing only
the essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success on
Gistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate
modeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially
large code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art models
struggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executions
traces.

TL;DR: ALMGuard是首个专门针对语音语言模型的防御框架，利用安全对齐的捷径特征识别通用捷径激活干扰，能有效抵御ALM特有的jailbreak攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法对ALM特有的越狱攻击无效，需要开发专门针对ALMs的防御框架。

Method: 通过识别ALMs中自然存在的安全对齐捷径，设计通用捷径激活干扰作为触发机制，并提出了Mel梯度稀疏掩码来优化攻击干扰。

Result: 将先进ALM特有越狱攻击的平均成功率降低至4.6%，同时在良性基准测试中保持良好性能。

Conclusion: ALMGuard在对抗已见和未见攻击方面表现出强大鲁棒性，成为该领域的新最先进技术。

Abstract: Recent advances in Audio-Language Models (ALMs) have significantly improved
multimodal understanding capabilities. However, the introduction of the audio
modality also brings new and unique vulnerability vectors. Previous studies
have proposed jailbreak attacks that specifically target ALMs, revealing that
defenses directly transferred from traditional audio adversarial attacks or
text-based Large Language Model (LLM) jailbreaks are largely ineffective
against these ALM-specific threats. To address this issue, we propose ALMGuard,
the first defense framework tailored to ALMs. Based on the assumption that
safety-aligned shortcuts naturally exist in ALMs, we design a method to
identify universal Shortcut Activation Perturbations (SAPs) that serve as
triggers that activate the safety shortcuts to safeguard ALMs at inference
time. To better sift out effective triggers while preserving the model's
utility on benign tasks, we further propose Mel-Gradient Sparse Mask (M-GSM),
which restricts perturbations to Mel-frequency bins that are sensitive to
jailbreaks but insensitive to speech understanding. Both theoretical analyses
and empirical results demonstrate the robustness of our method against both
seen and unseen attacks. Overall, \MethodName reduces the average success rate
of advanced ALM-specific jailbreak attacks to 4.6% across four models, while
maintaining comparable utility on benign benchmarks, establishing it as the new
state of the art. Our code and data are available at

Motivation: 现有TTS可理解性评估依赖词级准确率指标如WER，无法捕捉真实世界语音的复杂性或反映人类理解需求，存在瓶颈

Method: 提出Spoken-PassageMultiple-ChoiceQuestionAnswering主观评估方法，评估合成语音中关键信息的准确性，并发布SP-MCQA-Eval基准数据集

Result: 实验表明低WER不一定保证高关键信息准确性，即使最先进的模型在文本规范化和语音准确性方面仍有不足

Conclusion: 在众多系统已能优秀实现WER指标的当下，迫切需要更高层次、更接近真实场景的评估标准

Abstract: The evaluation of intelligibility for TTS has reached a bottleneck, as
existing assessments heavily rely on word-by-word accuracy metrics such as WER,
which fail to capture the complexity of real-world speech or reflect human
comprehension needs. To address this, we propose Spoken-Passage Multiple-Choice
Question Answering, a novel subjective approach evaluating the accuracy of key
information in synthesized speech, and release SP-MCQA-Eval, an 8.76-hour
news-style benchmark dataset for SP-MCQA evaluation. Our experiments reveal
that low WER does not necessarily guarantee high key-information accuracy,
exposing a gap between traditional metrics and practical intelligibility.
SP-MCQA shows that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models still lack robust text
normalization and phonetic accuracy. This work underscores the urgent need for
high-level, more life-like evaluation criteria now that many systems already
excel at WER yet may fall short on real-world intelligibility.

Motivation: 研究神经音频编解码器提供的连续向量和离散token两种语音表示形式，哪种更适合作为监督语音增强的训练目标，比较不同模型架构的性能差异。

Method: 使用基于Conformer架构的自回归和非自回归语音增强模型，以及简单的NAC编码器微调基线方法进行对比实验。

Result: 连续潜在表示预测优于离散token预测；自回归模型质量更高但影响可懂度和效率；编码器微调获得最强增强指标但会降低编解码重建质量。

Conclusion: 连续表示预测效果更好，非自回归模型更实用，编码器微调是增强效果最好的方法但需要权衡重建质量。

Abstract: Neural audio codecs (NACs) provide compact latent speech representations in
the form of sequences of continuous vectors or discrete tokens. In this work,
we investigate how these two types of speech representations compare when used
as training targets for supervised speech enhancement. We consider both
autoregressive and non-autoregressive speech enhancement models based on the
Conformer architecture, as well as a simple baseline where the NAC encoder is
simply fine-tuned for speech enhancement. Our experiments reveal three key
findings: predicting continuous latent representations consistently outperforms
discrete token prediction; autoregressive models achieve higher quality but at
the expense of intelligibility and efficiency, making non-autoregressive models
more attractive in practice; and encoder fine-tuning yields the strongest
enhancement metrics overall, though at the cost of degraded codec
reconstruction. The code and audio samples are available online.

Motivation: 目前的音频生成模型存在质量问题和泛化能力不足，导致开发冗余、性能不一和扩展性受限。为了解决这些问题，需要建立一个统一的音频生成框架。

Abstract: Generative modeling has recently achieved remarkable success across text,
image, and audio domains, demonstrating powerful capabilities for unified
representation learning. However, audio generation models still face challenges
in terms of audio quality and generalization ability across tasks. This
fragmentation results in redundant development efforts, inconsistent
performance, and limited extensibility. To address these issues, we propose
\textbf{UniTok-Audio}, a scalable and extensible framework for unified audio
generation tasks. Specifically, 1) UniTok-Audio extracts continuous feature of
conditions to generates discrete tokens of target audio in an autoregressive
manner; 2) a special task identifier token unifies different learning patterns
of multiple tasks in a single framework; 3) a dual-stream audio codec involving
acoustic and semantic branch is developed for high-fidelity waveform
reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that UniTok-Audio achieves
competitive performance in comparation with state-of-the-art task-specific or
multi-task systems across five time-aligned tasks: speech restoration, target
speaker extraction, speech separation, voice conversion, and language-queried
audio source separation. To foster future research, we will open-source our
codebase. The demo page of our work can be found here:

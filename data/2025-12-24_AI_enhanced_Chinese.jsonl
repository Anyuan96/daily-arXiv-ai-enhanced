Manual abstraction, although accurate, is prohibitively costly and unscalable. Existing automated approaches typically address narrow scenarios - either using synthetic datasets, restricting focus to document-level extraction, or isolating specific clinical variables (e.g., staging, biomarkers, histology) - and do not adequately handle patient-level synthesis across the large number of clinical documents containing contradictory information. In this study, we propose an agentic framework that systematically decomposes complex oncology data extraction into modular, adaptive tasks. Specifically, we use large language models (LLMs) as reasoning agents, equipped with context-sensitive retrieval and iterative synthesis capabilities, to exhaustively and comprehensively extract structured clinical variables from real-world oncology notes. Evaluated on a large-scale dataset of over 400,000 unstructured clinical notes and scanned PDF reports spanning 2,250 cancer patients, our method achieves an average F1-score of 0.93, with 100 out of 103 oncology-specific clinical variables exceeding 0.85, and critical variables (e.g., biomarkers and medications) surpassing 0.95. Moreover, integration of the agentic system into a data curation workflow resulted in 0.94 direct manual approval rate, significantly reducing annotation costs.

Establishing Baselines for Foundation Models in Educational Discourse", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in educational technologies for a variety of tasks, from generating instructional materials and assisting with assessment design to tutoring. While prior work has investigated how models can be adapted or optimized for specific tasks, far less is known about how well LLMs perform at interpreting authentic educational scenarios without significant customization. As LLM-based systems become widely adopted by learners and educators in everyday academic contexts, understanding their out-of-the-box capabilities is increasingly important for setting expectations and benchmarking. We compared six LLMs to estimate their baseline performance on a simple but important task: classifying instructional moves in authentic classroom transcripts. We evaluated typical prompting methods: zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting. We found that while zero-shot performance was moderate, providing comprehensive examples (few-shot prompting) significantly improved performance for state-of-the-art models, with the strongest configuration reaching Cohen's Kappa = 0.58 against expert-coded annotations. At the same time, improvements were neither uniform nor complete: performance varied considerably by instructional move, and higher recall frequently came at the cost of increased false positives. Overall, these findings indicate that foundation models demonstrate meaningful yet limited capacity to interpret instructional discourse, with prompt design helping to surface capability but not eliminating fundamental reliability constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u5355\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u8bfe\u5802\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2d\u6559\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4ecd\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u672a\u7ecf\u5b9a\u5236\u65f6\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bbe\u5b9a\u9884\u671f\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u516d\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bfe\u5802\u8bb0\u5f55\u6559\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u5355\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u4e09\u79cd\u5178\u578b\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff08Cohen's Kappa = 0.58\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u56e0\u6559\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u578b\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u9ad8\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u5f80\u5f80\u4f34\u968f\u7740\u8bef\u62a5\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u4f46\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u8bdd\u8bed\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u53d1\u6398\u6f5c\u529b\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u6d88\u9664\u6839\u672c\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

Because bold language can stem from either strong empirical results or mere rhetorical style, it is often difficult to distinguish between the two. To disentangle rhetorical style from substantive content, we introduce a counterfactual, LLM-based framework: multiple LLM rhetorical personas generate counterfactual writings from the same substantive content, an LLM judge compares them through pairwise evaluations, and the outcomes are aggregated using a Bradley--Terry model. Applying this method to 8,485 ICLR submissions sampled from 2017 to 2025, we generate more than 250,000 counterfactual writings and provide a large-scale quantification of rhetorical style in ML papers. We find that visionary framing significantly predicts downstream attention, including citations and media attention, even after controlling for peer-review evaluations. We also observe a sharp rise in rhetorical strength after 2023, and provide empirical evidence showing that this increase is largely driven by the adoption of LLM-based writing assistance. The reliability of our framework is validated by its robustness to the choice of personas and the high correlation between LLM judgments and human annotations.

This limitation obscures the critical interplay between individual cognitive biases and information propagation, thereby hindering a mechanistic understanding of how ideological divides are amplified. To address this challenge, we introduce the Personality-Refracted Intelligent Simulation Model (PRISM), a hybrid framework coupling stochastic differential equations (SDE) for continuous emotional evolution with a personality-conditional partially observable Markov decision process (PC-POMDP) for discrete decision-making. In contrast to continuous trait approaches, PRISM assigns distinct Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) based cognitive policies to multimodal large language model (MLLM) agents, initialized via data-driven priors from large-scale social media datasets.

Despite their advances, these systems remain vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce PHANTOM (PHysical ANamorphic Threats Obstructing connected vehicle Mobility), a novel framework for crafting and deploying perspective-dependent adversarial examples using \\textit{anamorphic art}. PHANTOM exploits geometric distortions that appear natural to humans but are misclassified with high confidence by state-of-the-art object detectors. Unlike conventional attacks, PHANTOM operates in black-box settings without model access and demonstrates strong transferability across four diverse detector architectures (YOLOv5, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet). Comprehensive evaluation in CARLA across varying speeds, weather conditions, and lighting scenarios shows that PHANTOM achieves over 90\\% attack success rate under optimal conditions and maintains 60-80\\% effectiveness even in degraded environments. The attack activates within 6-10 meters of the target, providing insufficient time for safe maneuvering. Beyond individual vehicle deception, PHANTOM triggers network-wide disruption in CAV systems: SUMO-OMNeT++ co-simulation demonstrates that false emergency messages propagate through V2X links, increasing Peak Age of Information by 68-89\\% and degrading safety-critical communication.

Given a noisy mixture and two potentially unreliable cues, a dedicated network is trained to dynamically balance their contributions-or disregard the less informative one when necessary.

While their responses often sound fluent and natural, they can also carry subtle tone biases such as sounding overly polite, cheerful, or cautious even when neutrality is expected. These tendencies can influence how users perceive trust, empathy, and fairness in dialogue. In this study, we explore tone bias as a hidden behavioral trait of large language models. The novelty of this research lies in the integration of controllable large language model based dialogue synthesis with tone classification models, enabling robust and ethical emotion recognition in personal assistant interactions. We created two synthetic dialogue datasets, one generated from neutral prompts and another explicitly guided to produce positive or negative tones. Surprisingly, even the neutral set showed consistent tonal skew, suggesting that bias may stem from the model's underlying conversational style. Using weak supervision through a pretrained DistilBERT model, we labeled tones and trained several classifiers to detect these patterns. Ensemble models achieved macro F1 scores up to 0.92, showing that tone bias is systematic, measurable, and relevant to designing fair and trustworthy conversational AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u8c03\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4e2d\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u8bed\u8c03\u503e\u659c\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u79ef\u6781\u548c\u793c\u8c8c\u503e\u5411\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u89c1\u5177\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u63a7\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5408\u6210\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5e94\u5bf9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u56de\u7b54\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u8bed\u8c03\u504f\u89c1\uff08\u5982\u8fc7\u5ea6\u793c\u8c8c\u3001\u4e50\u89c2\u6216\u8c28\u614e\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u89c1\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u4fe1\u4efb\u3001\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8861\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u6574\u5408\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u8bed\u8c03\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff1a1\uff09\u521b\u5efa\u4e24\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u4e2d\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u96c6\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u5f15\u5bfc\u96c6\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3DistilBERT\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u6807\u8bb0\uff1b3\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u4e2a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bed\u8c03\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u5b8f\u89c2F1\u5206\u65700.92\uff1b\u4e2d\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u8bed\u8c03\u503e\u659c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u504f\u89c1\u6765\u6e90\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u5bf9\u8bdd\u98ce\u683c\uff1b\u8bed\u8c03\u504f\u89c1\u5177\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8c03\u504f\u89c1\u662f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u9690\u85cf\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5bf9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u516c\u5e73\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u5bf9\u8bddAI\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u63a7\u5408\u6210\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u89c1\u3002"}}

Although motion blur obscures image details and degrades visual quality, it also encodes information about scene and camera motion during an exposure. Previous techniques leverage this information to estimate a sharp image from an input blurry one, or to predict a sequence of video frames showing what might have occurred at the moment of image capture. However, they rely on handcrafted priors or network architectures to resolve ambiguities in this inverse problem, and do not incorporate image and video priors on large-scale datasets. As such, existing methods struggle to reproduce complex scene dynamics and do not attempt to recover what occurred before or after an image was taken. Here, we introduce a new technique that repurposes a pre-trained video diffusion model trained on internet-scale datasets to recover videos revealing complex scene dynamics during the moment of capture and what might have occurred immediately into the past or future. Our approach is robust and versatile; it outperforms previous methods for this task, generalizes to challenging in-the-wild images, and supports downstream tasks such as recovering camera trajectories, object motion, and dynamic 3D scene structure.

Among existing methods, upsampling-based time-domain models are superior in both inference speed and synthesis quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Still, despite their success in producing perceptually natural sound, their synthesis fidelity remains limited due to the aliasing artifacts brought by the inadequately designed model architectures. In particular, the unconstrained nonlinear activation generates an infinite number of harmonics that exceed the Nyquist frequency, resulting in ``folded-back'' aliasing artifacts. The widely used upsampling layer, ConvTranspose, copies the mirrored low-frequency parts to fill the empty high-frequency region, resulting in ``mirrored'' aliasing artifacts. Meanwhile, the combination of its inherent periodicity and the mirrored DC bias also brings ``tonal artifact,'' resulting in constant-frequency ringing. This paper aims to solve these issues from a signal processing perspective. Specifically, we apply oversampling and anti-derivative anti-aliasing to the activation function to obtain its anti-aliased form, and replace the problematic ConvTranspose layer with resampling to avoid the ``tonal artifact'' and eliminate aliased components. Based on our proposed anti-aliased modules, we introduce Pupu-Vocoder and Pupu-Codec, and release high-quality pre-trained checkpoints to facilitate audio generation research. We build a test signal benchmark to illustrate the effectiveness of the anti-aliased modules, and conduct experiments on speech, singing voice, music, and audio to validate our proposed models. Experimental results confirm that our lightweight Pupu-Vocoder and Pupu-Codec models can easily outperform existing systems on singing voice, music, and audio, while achieving comparable performance on speech.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Pupu-Vocoder\u548cPupu-Codec\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u58f0\u7801\u5668\u548c\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u56e0\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0d\u5f53\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6df7\u53e0\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u97f3\u9891\u5408\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u65f6\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u5728\u4eba\u8033\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u5408\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f3a\u9677\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u548cConvTranspose\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u5c42\uff09\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6298\u53e0\u6df7\u53e0\u3001\u955c\u50cf\u6df7\u53e0\u548c\u97f3\u8c03\u5931\u771f\u7b49\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u6df7\u53e0\u4f2a\u5f71\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u89d2\u5ea6\u63d0\u51fa\u6297\u6df7\u53e0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff1a1\uff09\u5bf9\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u5e94\u7528\u8fc7\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u6297\u5bfc\u6570\u6297\u6df7\u53e0\u6280\u672f\uff1b2\uff09\u7528\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u4ee3\u66ff\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u7684ConvTranspose\u5c42\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u97f3\u8c03\u5931\u771f\u5e76\u6d88\u9664\u6df7\u53e0\u5206\u91cf\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6297\u6df7\u53e0\u6a21\u5757\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Pupu-Vocoder\u548cPupu-Codec\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684Pupu-Vocoder\u548cPupu-Codec\u5728\u6b4c\u5531\u58f0\u97f3\u3001\u97f3\u4e50\u548c\u901a\u7528\u97f3\u9891\u5408\u6210\u4e0a\u8f7b\u677e\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6297\u6df7\u53e0\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4fe1\u53f7\u57fa\u51c6\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u58f0\u7801\u5668\u548c\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u6df7\u53e0\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6297\u6df7\u53e0\u6a21\u5757\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u97f3\u9891\u5408\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u97f3\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

In addition, standard architectures typically decouple text and audio processing, limiting the ability to align instructions with specific acoustic contexts.\n  To address these challenges, we propose MMEdit, an audio-language-model-driven framework for unified audio editing.

However, existing works and our pilot study have shown that as dialogue histories grow in length and accumulate noise, current long-context models struggle to accurately identify temporally pertinent information, significantly impairing reasoning performance. To address this, we introduce Memory-T1, a framework that learns a time-aware memory selection policy using reinforcement learning (RL). It employs a coarse-to-fine strategy, first pruning the dialogue history into a candidate set using temporal and relevance filters, followed by an RL agent that selects the precise evidence sessions. The RL training is guided by a multi-level reward function optimizing (i) answer accuracy, (ii) evidence grounding, and (iii) temporal consistency. In particular, the temporal consistency reward provides a dense signal by evaluating alignment with the query time scope at both the session-level (chronological proximity) and the utterance-level (chronological fidelity), enabling the agent to resolve subtle chronological ambiguities. On the Time-Dialog benchmark, Memory-T1 boosts a 7B model to an overall score of 67.0\\%, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance for open-source models and outperforming a 14B baseline by 10.2\\%. Ablation studies show temporal consistency and evidence grounding rewards jointly contribute to a 15.0\\% performance gain. Moreover, Memory-T1 maintains robustness up to 128k tokens, where baseline models collapse, proving effectiveness against noise in extensive dialogue histories.

In a non-robust setting, the ``gold standard'' scoring function, known as the geometric error, follows from a probabilistic model with Gaussian noises. We extend it to spherical noises. In a robust setting, we consider a mixture with uniformly distributed outliers and show that a threshold-based parameterization leads to a unified view of likelihood-based and robust M-estimators and associated local optimization schemes.\n  Next we analyze MAGSAC++ which stands out for two reasons. First, it achieves the best results according to existing benchmarks. Second, it makes quite different modeling assumptions and derivation steps. We discovered, however that the derivation does not correspond to sound principles and the resulting score function is in fact numerically equivalent to a simple Gaussian-uniform likelihood, a basic model within the proposed framework.\n  Finally, we propose an experimental methodology for evaluating scoring functions: assuming either a large validation set, or a small random validation set in expectation. We find that all scoring functions, including using a learned inlier distribution, perform identically. In particular, MAGSAC++ score is found to be neither better performing than simple contenders nor less sensitive to the choice of the threshold hyperparameter.\n  Our theoretical and experimental analysis thus comprehensively revisit the state-of-the-art, which is critical for any future research seeking to improve the methods or apply them to other robust fitting problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4e86RANSAC\u51e0\u4f55\u62df\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0MAGSAC++\u7684\u63a8\u5bfc\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u9ad8\u65af-\u5747\u5300\u4f3c\u7136\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5404\u79cd\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u540c\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30RANSAC\u51e0\u4f55\u62df\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5206\u6790\u5f53\u524d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u7684MAGSAC++\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u9760\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "1. \u6269\u5c55\u51e0\u4f55\u8bef\u5dee\u5230\u7403\u5f62\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2. \u8003\u8651\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff1b3. \u5206\u6790MAGSAC++\u7684\u63a8\u5bfc\u95ee\u9898\uff1b4. \u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0MAGSAC++\u7684\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e0d\u7b26\u5408\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5176\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u6570\u503c\u4e0a\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u65af-\u5747\u5300\u4f3c\u7136\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4f7f\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u540c\uff0cMAGSAC++\u5e76\u4e0d\u4f18\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u5bf9\u624b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0MAGSAC++\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8868\u73b0\u88ab\u9ad8\u4f30\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u6216\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u9c81\u68d2\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

Recently, text classification based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has made significant progress due to their strong capabilities of structural relationship learning. However, these approaches still face two major limitations. First, these approaches fail to fully consider the diverse structural information across word pairs, e.g., co-occurrence, syntax, and semantics. Furthermore, they neglect sequence information in the text graph structure information learning module and can not classify texts with new words and relations. In this paper, we propose a Novel Graph-Sequence Learning Model for Inductive Text Classification (TextGSL) to address the previously mentioned issues. More specifically, we construct a single text-level graph for all words in each text and establish different edge types based on the diverse relationships between word pairs. Building upon this, we design an adaptive multi-edge message-passing paradigm to aggregate diverse structural information between word pairs. Additionally, sequential information among text data can be captured by the proposed TextGSL through the incorporation of Transformer layers. Therefore, TextGSL can learn more discriminative text representations. TextGSL has been comprehensively compared with several strong baselines. The experimental results on diverse benchmarking datasets demonstrate that TextGSL outperforms these baselines in terms of accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684TextGSL\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5355\u6587\u672c\u7ea7\u56fe\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u591a\u7c7b\u578b\u8fb9\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u8fb9\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u548cTransformer\u5c42\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709GNN\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u4fe1\u606f\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eGNN\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u8bcd\u5bf9\u95f4\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u5171\u73b0\u3001\u8bed\u6cd5\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\uff09\uff0c\u4e8c\u662f\u5728\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u4e2d\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5e8f\u5217\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u65b0\u8bcd\u548c\u65b0\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "1. \u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u6784\u5efa\u5355\u6587\u672c\u7ea7\u56fe\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bcd\u5bf9\u95f4\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u7acb\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u8fb9\uff1b2. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u8fb9\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u673a\u5236\u6765\u805a\u5408\u8bcd\u5bf9\u95f4\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b3. \u5f15\u5165Transformer\u5c42\u6355\u83b7\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u5177\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTextGSL\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "TextGSL\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

We systematically evaluate frontier models under ABBEL across six diverse multi-step environments, finding that ABBEL supports generating interpretable beliefs while maintaining near-constant memory use over interaction steps. However, bottleneck approaches are generally prone to error propagation, which we observe causing inferior performance when compared to the full context setting due to errors in belief updating. Therefore, we train LLMs to generate and act on beliefs within the ABBEL framework via reinforcement learning (RL). We experiment with belief grading, to reward higher quality beliefs, as well as belief length penalties to reward more compressed beliefs. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of RL to improve ABBEL's performance beyond the full context setting, while using less memory than contemporaneous approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "ABBEL\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u74f6\u9888\u6765\u538b\u7f29\u591a\u6b65\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8fd1\u6052\u5b9a\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u4e8e\u5b8c\u6574\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5b8c\u6574\u4ea4\u4e92\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4fdd\u6301\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faABBEL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4fe1\u5ff5\u72b6\u6001\uff08\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u672a\u77e5\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6458\u8981\uff09\u66ff\u4ee3\u957f\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u5148\u66f4\u65b0\u4fe1\u5ff5\u518d\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u5ff5\u9009\u62e9\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u6539\u8fdb\u4fe1\u5ff5\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u591a\u6b65\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cABBEL\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4fe1\u5ff5\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8fd1\u6052\u5b9a\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5355\u7eaf\u4fe1\u5ff5\u74f6\u9888\u6613\u53d7\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u5f71\u54cd\uff1bRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8fc7\u5b8c\u6574\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "ABBEL\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Prior work focuses largely on web pages and mobile screens, leaving app widgets underexplored. Unlike web or mobile UIs with rich hierarchical context, widgets are compact, context-free micro-interfaces that summarize key information through dense layouts and iconography under strict spatial constraints. Moreover, while (image, code) pairs are widely available for web or mobile UIs, widget designs are proprietary and lack accessible markup. We formalize this setting as the Widget-to-Code (Widget2Code) and introduce an image-only widget benchmark with fine-grained, multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. Benchmarking shows that although generalized multimodal large language models (MLLMs) outperform specialized UI2Code methods, they still produce unreliable and visually inconsistent code. To address these limitations, we develop a baseline that jointly advances perceptual understanding and structured code generation. At the perceptual level, we follow widget design principles to assemble atomic components into complete layouts, equipped with icon retrieval and reusable visualization modules. At the system level, we design an end-to-end infrastructure, WidgetFactory, which includes a framework-agnostic widget-tailored domain-specific language (WidgetDSL) and a compiler that translates it into multiple front-end implementations (e.g., React, HTML/CSS). An adaptive rendering module further refines spatial dimensions to satisfy compactness constraints. Together, these contributions substantially enhance visual fidelity, establishing a strong baseline and unified infrastructure for future Widget2Code research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Widget-to-Code\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edfUI2Code\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u65e0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5fae\u754c\u9762\u5c0f\u90e8\u4ef6\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86WidgetFactory\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfUI2Code\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u7f51\u9875\u548c\u79fb\u52a8\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u800c\u5c0f\u90e8\u4ef6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u65e0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5fae\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86WidgetFactory\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u611f\u77e5\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7ec4\u88c5\u3001\u56fe\u6807\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u65e0\u5173\u7684WidgetDSL\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u524d\u7aef\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6e32\u67d3\u6a21\u5757\u4f18\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e13\u7528UI2Code\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002WidgetFactory\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5f3a\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5c0f\u90e8\u4ef6\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u8fdb\u611f\u77e5\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u4e3aWidget2Code\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, existing methods often suffer from multi-source entanglement and audio-visual misalignment, which lead to biases toward louder or larger objects while overlooking weaker, smaller, or co-occurring sources. To address these challenges, we propose DDAVS, a Disentangled Audio Semantics and Delayed Bidirectional Alignment framework. To mitigate multi-source entanglement, DDAVS employs learnable queries to extract audio semantics and anchor them within a structured semantic space derived from an audio prototype memory bank. This is further optimized through contrastive learning to enhance discriminability and robustness. To alleviate audio-visual misalignment, DDAVS introduces dual cross-attention with delayed modality interaction, improving the robustness of multimodal alignment. Extensive experiments on the AVS-Objects and VPO benchmarks demonstrate that DDAVS consistently outperforms existing approaches, exhibiting strong performance across single-source, multi-source, and multi-instance scenarios. These results validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our framework under challenging real-world audio-visual segmentation conditions.

Despite their recent success, multimodal RAG in the audio-visual domain remains challenging due to 1) limited modality coverage and multi-hop connectivity of existing MMKGs, and 2) retrieval based solely on similarity in a shared multimodal embedding space, which fails to filter out off-topic or redundant knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose M$^3$KG-RAG, a Multi-hop Multimodal Knowledge Graph-enhanced RAG that retrieves query-aligned audio-visual knowledge from MMKGs, improving reasoning depth and answer faithfulness in MLLMs. Specifically, we devise a lightweight multi-agent pipeline to construct multi-hop MMKG (M$^3$KG), which contains context-enriched triplets of multimodal entities, enabling modality-wise retrieval based on input queries. Furthermore, we introduce GRASP (Grounded Retrieval And Selective Pruning), which ensures precise entity grounding to the query, evaluates answer-supporting relevance, and prunes redundant context to retain only knowledge essential for response generation. Extensive experiments across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that M$^3$KG-RAG significantly enhances MLLMs' multimodal reasoning and grounding over existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "M\u00b3KG-RAG\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u8df3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b9e\u4f53\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u4fee\u526a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001RAG\u5728\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u591a\u8df3\u8fde\u63a5\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65e0\u5173\u6216\u5197\u4f59\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u8df3MMKG\uff08M\u00b3KG\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b9e\u4f53\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff1b2\uff09\u63d0\u51faGRASP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u63a5\u5730\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b54\u6848\u652f\u6301\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5e76\u4fee\u526a\u5197\u4f59\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cM\u00b3KG-RAG\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u63a5\u5730\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "M\u00b3KG-RAG\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8df3\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001RAG\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This involves aligning both the cortical surface of the brain and the interior volume. Traditional methods treat volumetric and surface-based registration separately, which often leads to inconsistencies that limit downstream analyses. We propose a deep learning framework, NeurAlign, that registers $3$D brain MRI images by jointly aligning both cortical and subcortical regions through a unified volume-and-surface-based representation. Our approach leverages an intermediate spherical coordinate space to bridge anatomical surface topology with volumetric anatomy, enabling consistent and anatomically accurate alignment. By integrating spherical registration into the learning, our method ensures geometric coherence between volume and surface domains. In a series of experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, our method consistently outperforms both classical and machine learning-based registration methods -- improving the Dice score by up to 7 points while maintaining regular deformation fields. Additionally, it is orders of magnitude faster than the standard method for this task, and is simpler to use because it requires no additional inputs beyond an MRI scan.

We introduce Fun-Audio-Chat, a Large Audio Language Model addressing these limitations via two innovations from our previous work DrVoice. First, Dual-Resolution Speech Representations (DRSR): the Shared LLM processes audio at efficient 5Hz (via token grouping), while the Speech Refined Head generates high-quality tokens at 25Hz, balancing efficiency (~50% GPU reduction) and quality. Second, Core-Cocktail Training, a two-stage fine-tuning with intermediate merging that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. We then apply Multi-Task DPO Training to enhance robustness, audio understanding, instruction-following and voice empathy. This multi-stage post-training enables Fun-Audio-Chat to retain text LLM knowledge while gaining powerful audio understanding, reasoning, and generation. Unlike recent LALMs requiring large-scale audio-text pre-training, Fun-Audio-Chat leverages pre-trained models and extensive post-training. Fun-Audio-Chat 8B and MoE 30B-A3B achieve competitive performance on Speech-to-Text and Speech-to-Speech tasks, ranking top among similar-scale models on Spoken QA benchmarks. They also achieve competitive to superior performance on Audio Understanding, Speech Function Calling, Instruction-Following and Voice Empathy.

To handle complex multi-hop questions that are challenging for single-step retrieval, iterative RAG approaches incorporating reinforcement learning have been proposed. However, existing iterative RAG systems typically plan to decompose questions without leveraging information about the available retrieval corpus, leading to inefficient retrieval and reasoning chains that cascade into suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce Early Knowledge Alignment (EKA), a simple but effective module that aligns LLMs with retrieval set before planning in iterative RAG systems with contextually relevant retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments on six standard RAG datasets demonstrate that by establishing a stronger reasoning foundation, EKA significantly improves retrieval precision, reduces cascading errors, and enhances both performance and efficiency. Our analysis from an entropy perspective demonstrate that incorporating early knowledge reduces unnecessary exploration during the reasoning process, enabling the model to focus more effectively on relevant information subsets. Moreover, EKA proves effective as a versatile, training-free inference strategy that scales seamlessly to large models. Generalization tests across diverse datasets and retrieval corpora confirm the robustness of our approach. Overall, EKA advances the state-of-the-art in iterative RAG systems while illuminating the critical interplay between structured reasoning and efficient exploration in reinforcement learning-augmented frameworks.

Existing approaches lack effective learning of vehicle-related knowledge during pre-training, resulting in poor capability for modeling general vehicle perception representations. To handle this problem, we propose VehicleMAE-V2, a novel vehicle-centric pre-trained large model. By exploring and exploiting vehicle-related multimodal structured priors to guide the masked token reconstruction process, our approach can significantly enhance the model's capability to learn generalizable representations for vehicle-centric perception. Specifically, we design the Symmetry-guided Mask Module (SMM), Contour-guided Representation Module (CRM) and Semantics-guided Representation Module (SRM) to incorporate three kinds of structured priors into token reconstruction including symmetry, contour and semantics of vehicles respectively. SMM utilizes the vehicle symmetry constraints to avoid retaining symmetric patches and can thus select high-quality masked image patches and reduce information redundancy. CRM minimizes the probability distribution divergence between contour features and reconstructed features and can thus preserve holistic vehicle structure information during pixel-level reconstruction. SRM aligns image-text features through contrastive learning and cross-modal distillation to address the feature confusion caused by insufficient semantic understanding during masked reconstruction. To support the pre-training of VehicleMAE-V2, we construct Autobot4M, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 4 million vehicle images and 12,693 text descriptions.

This requires extracting semantic representations directly from speech. Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce SpidR, a self-supervised speech representation model that efficiently learns representations with highly accessible phonetic information, which makes it particularly suited for textless spoken language modeling. It is trained on raw waveforms using a masked prediction objective combined with self-distillation and online clustering. The intermediate layers of the student model learn to predict assignments derived from the teacher's intermediate layers. This learning objective stabilizes the online clustering procedure compared to previous approaches, resulting in higher quality codebooks. SpidR outperforms wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM, and DinoSR on downstream language modeling benchmarks (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC). Second, we systematically evaluate across models and layers the correlation between speech unit quality (ABX, PNMI) and language modeling performance, validating these metrics as reliable proxies. Finally, SpidR significantly reduces pretraining time compared to HuBERT, requiring only one day of pretraining on 16 GPUs, instead of a week. This speedup is enabled by the pretraining method and an efficient codebase, which allows faster iteration and easier experimentation.

Researchers have effectively employed the ``pre-train, prompt, and predict'' paradigm through prompt learning to induce improved few-shot performance. However, prompt learning approaches for PFMs still follow a parametric learning paradigm. As such, the stability of generalization in memorization and rote learning can be compromised. More specifically, conventional prompt learning might face difficulties in fully utilizing atypical instances and avoiding overfitting to shallow patterns with limited data during the process of fully-supervised training. To overcome these constraints, we present our approach, named RetroPrompt, which aims to achieve a balance between memorization and generalization by decoupling knowledge from mere memorization. Unlike traditional prompting methods, RetroPrompt leverages a publicly accessible knowledge base generated from the training data and incorporates a retrieval mechanism throughout the input, training, and inference stages. This enables the model to actively retrieve relevant contextual information from the corpus, thereby enhancing the available cues. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a variety of datasets across natural language processing and computer vision tasks to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach, RetroPrompt, in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios.

Andy Keller"], "title": "Block-Recurrent Dynamics in Vision Transformers", "comment": "25 pages, 15 figures", "summary": "As Vision Transformers (ViTs) become standard vision backbones, a mechanistic account of their computational phenomenology is essential. Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \\ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent computational cost. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors. Altogether, we find a compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5757\u9012\u5f52\u5047\u8bbe(BRH)\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3aTransformer\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0d\u662f\u786e\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u91cd\u65b0\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u5faa\u73af\u5757\u6765\u91cd\u73b0\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2aRaptor\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5047\u8bbe\uff0cDINOv2\u57282\u4e2ablock\u4e0b\u8fbe\u523096%\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u7387\u3002\u5c06\u6df1\u5ea6\u89c6\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e86token\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u73b0\u8c61\u548c\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u7684\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136Vision Transformer(ViT)\u6210\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u7684\u673a\u7406\u89e3\u91ca\u4ecd\u7136\u7f3a\u4e4f\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u4f46\u6ca1\u6709\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u5c06Transformer\u6df1\u5ea6\u89c6\u4e3a\u826f\u597d\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u6d41\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5757\u9012\u5f52\u5047\u8bbe(BRH)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u5757\u9012\u5f52\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578bRaptor\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5047\u8bbe\u3002\u89c2\u5bdf\u5c42\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u76f8\u4f3c\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22token\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u968f\u673a\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u62df\u5408Raptor\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u660eBRH\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2aRaptor\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ec52\u4e2ablock\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u4e86DINOv2 ImageNet-1k\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b96%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86token\u7279\u5b9a\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u6536\u655b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6cbf\u7740ViT\u6df1\u5ea6\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u6307\u5411\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u89c4\u8303\u89e3\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u539f\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

At its core is a novel coarse-to-fine autonomous data generation pipeline without manual intervention. This pipeline leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and adaptive projection adjustment for hierarchical analysis, ensuring the holistic segmentation of objects and their physical context. The resulting data pairs are both semantically meaningful and geometrically consistent, even when sourced from unlabeled panoramas. Furthermore, we introduce a cost-effective, two-stage data refinement strategy to improve data realism and mitigate model overfitting to erase artifacts. Based on the constructed dataset, we train a Transformer-based diffusion model to allow flexible object editing guided by text, mask, or reference image in 360$^\\circ$ panoramas.

However, our research identifies a vulnerability: LLMs can be manipulated by \"adversarial instructions\" hidden in input data, such as resumes or code, causing them to deviate from their intended task. Notably, while defenses may exist for mature domains such as code review, they are often absent in other common applications such as resume screening and peer review. This paper introduces a benchmark to assess this vulnerability in resume screening, revealing attack success rates exceeding 80% for certain attack types. We evaluate two defense mechanisms: prompt-based defenses achieve 10.1% attack reduction with 12.5% false rejection increase, while our proposed FIDS (Foreign Instruction Detection through Separation) using LoRA adaptation achieves 15.4% attack reduction with 10.4% false rejection increase.

To achieve this, we first synthesize training data with explanations via advanced LLMs and apply a well-defined data filtering strategy to ensure label correctness, explanation quality, and data diversity. Subsequently, we fine-tune the model on these well-curated training data as a cold start and further optimize it with rule-based reinforcement learning, using rewards for both prediction correctness and explanation quality. Results on 12 diverse tasks show that the 8B-parameter FaithLens outperforms advanced models such as GPT-4.1 and o3.

However, the clinical relevance of the tissue characteristics at the micro- and macro-environment level is limited by the lack of tools that facilitate the measurement of the spatial interaction of individual structure characteristics and their association with clinical parameters. To address these challenges, we introduce HistoWAS (Histology-Wide Association Study), a computational framework designed to link tissue spatial organization to clinical outcomes. Specifically, HistoWAS implements (1) a feature space that augments conventional metrics with 30 topological and spatial features, adapted from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) point pattern analysis, to quantify tissue micro-architecture; and (2) an association study engine, inspired by Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS), that performs mass univariate regression for each feature with statistical correction. As a proof of concept, we applied HistoWAS to analyze a total of 102 features (72 conventional object-level features and our 30 spatial features) using 385 PAS-stained WSIs from 206 participants in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP).

The corpus consists of 5 hours of speech recordings with ASR and gold transcripts in 12 original languages and automatic and corrected translations into English. For the purposes of research into cross-lingual summarization, our corpus also includes written summaries (minutes) of the meetings.\n  Moreover, we propose automatic detection of misunderstandings. For an overview of this task and its complexity, we attempt to quantify misunderstandings in cross-lingual meetings.

However, existing MIL methods focus on optimizing feature extractors and aggregation strategies while overlooking the complex semantic relationships among instances within whole slide image (WSI). Although Transformer-based MIL approaches aiming to model instance dependencies, the quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability to large-scale WSIs. Moreover, due to the pronounced variations in tumor region scales across different WSIs, existing Transformer-based methods employing fixed-scale attention mechanisms face significant challenges in precisely capturing local instance correlations and fail to account for the distance-based decay effect of patch relevance. To address these challenges, we propose window scale decay MIL (WSD-MIL), designed to enhance the capacity to model tumor regions of varying scales while improving computational efficiency. WSD-MIL comprises: 1) a window scale decay based attention module, which employs a cluster-based sampling strategy to reduce computational costs while progressively decaying attention window-scale to capture local instance relationships at varying scales; and 2) a squeeze-and-excitation based region gate module, which dynamically adjusts window weights to enhance global information modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that WSD-MIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CAMELYON16 and TCGA-BRCA datasets while reducing 62% of the computational memory.

However, since preferences of each user may vary, existing under-specified formulations often lead to suboptimal results that fail to align with individual user needs. We introduce a novel task that conditions paper-to-slides generation on user-specified preferences. We propose a human behavior-inspired agentic framework, SlideTailor, that progressively generates editable slides in a user-aligned manner. Instead of requiring users to write their preferences in detailed textual form, our system only asks for a paper-slides example pair and a visual template - natural and easy-to-provide artifacts that implicitly encode rich user preferences across content and visual style. Despite the implicit and unlabeled nature of these inputs, our framework effectively distills and generalizes the preferences to guide customized slide generation. We also introduce a novel chain-of-speech mechanism to align slide content with planned oral narration. Such a design significantly enhances the quality of generated slides and enables downstream applications like video presentations. To support this new task, we construct a benchmark dataset that captures diverse user preferences, with carefully designed interpretable metrics for robust evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86SlideTailor\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u8bba\u6587-\u5e7b\u706f\u7247\u793a\u4f8b\u5bf9\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u677f\u6765\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u751f\u6210\u6f14\u793a\u6587\u7a3f\u5e7b\u706f\u7247\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5e7b\u706f\u7247\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u5dee\u5f02\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u4ee4\u4eba\u6ee1\u610f\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u7528\u6237\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u9700\u6c42\u5b9a\u5236\u5e7b\u706f\u7247\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSlideTailor\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u8bba\u6587-\u5e7b\u706f\u7247\u793a\u4f8b\u5bf9\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u677f\uff08\u800c\u975e\u8be6\u7ec6\u6587\u5b57\u63cf\u8ff0\uff09\u6765\u9690\u542b\u5b66\u4e60\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165chain-of-speech\u673a\u5236\u786e\u4fdd\u5e7b\u706f\u7247\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u53e3\u5934\u53d9\u8ff0\u534f\u8c03\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u62bd\u53d6\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u5e7b\u706f\u7247\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u89c6\u9891\u6f14\u793a\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "SlideTailor\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5e7b\u706f\u7247\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5185\u5bb9-\u53e3\u8bed\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

In a nation like Bangladesh, enhancing guava production and agricultural practices plays a crucial role in its economy. Anthracnose and fruit fly infection can lower the quality and productivity of guava, a crucial tropical fruit. Expert systems that detect diseases early can reduce losses and safeguard the harvest. Images of guava fruits classified into the Healthy, Fruit Flies, and Anthracnose classes are included in the Guava Fruit Disease Dataset 2024 (GFDD24), which comes from plantations in Rajshahi and Pabna, Bangladesh. This study aims to create models using CNN alongside traditional machine learning techniques that can effectively identify guava diseases in locally cultivated varieties in Bangladesh. In order to achieve the highest classification accuracy of approximately 99.99% for the guava dataset, we propose utilizing ensemble models that combine CNNML with Gradient Boosting Machine.

Existing weakly supervised approaches often struggle to align fine-grained spatial structures with coarse labels, leading to noisy supervision and degraded mapping accuracy. To tackle this problem, we propose DDTM, a dual-branch weakly supervised framework that explicitly decouples local semantic refinement from global contextual reasoning. Specifically, DDTM introduces a diffusion-based branch to progressively refine fine-scale local semantics under coarse supervision, while a transformer-based branch enforces long-range contextual consistency across large spatial extents. In addition, we design a pseudo-label confidence evaluation module to mitigate noise induced by cross-resolution inconsistencies and to selectively exploit reliable supervisory signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDTM establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Chesapeake Bay benchmark, achieving 66.52\\% mIoU and substantially outperforming prior weakly supervised methods.

However, their application to image animation remains limited, even when trained on large-scale datasets. Two primary challenges contribute to this: the high dimensionality of video signals leads to a scarcity of training data, causing DMs to favor memorization over prompt compliance when generating motion; moreover, DMs struggle to generalize to novel motion patterns not present in the training set, and fine-tuning them to learn such patterns, especially using limited training data, is still under-explored. To address these limitations, we propose Modular Image-to-Video Adapter (MIVA), a lightweight sub-network attachable to a pre-trained DM, each designed to capture a single motion pattern and scalable via parallelization.

We address this gap for Bangla by introducing BanglaRiddleEval, a benchmark of 1,244 traditional Bangla riddles instantiated across four tasks (4,976 riddle-task artifacts in total). Using an LLM-based pipeline, we generate Chain-of-Thought explanations, semantically coherent distractors, and fine-grained ambiguity annotations, and evaluate a diverse suite of open-source and closed-source models under different prompting strategies. Models achieve moderate semantic overlap on generative QA but low correctness, MCQ accuracy peaks at only about 56% versus an 83% human baseline, and ambiguity resolution ranges from roughly 26% to 68%, with high-quality explanations confined to the strongest models.

To drive progress against these failures, we present LaSeRS, the first large-scale dataset built for comprehensive training and evaluation across four critical dimensions of language-guided segmentation: hierarchical granularity, target multiplicity, reasoning requirements, and linguistic variability. By capturing these dimensions, LaSeRS moves beyond simple commands, providing a benchmark for complex geospatial reasoning. This addresses a critical gap: existing datasets oversimplify, leading to sensitivity-prone real-world models. We also propose SegEarth-R2, an MLLM architecture designed for comprehensive language-guided segmentation in RS, which directly confronts these challenges. The model's effectiveness stems from two key improvements: (1) a spatial attention supervision mechanism specifically handles the localization of small objects and their components, and (2) a flexible and efficient segmentation query mechanism that handles both single-target and multi-target scenarios.

We present a multi-perspective validation framework for LLM-based thematic analysis that combines ensemble validation with dual reliability metrics: Cohen's Kappa ($\u03ba$) for inter-rater agreement and cosine similarity for semantic consistency. Our framework enables configurable analysis parameters (1-6 seeds, temperature 0.0-2.0), supports custom prompt structures with variable substitution, and provides consensus theme extraction across any JSON format. As proof-of-concept, we evaluate three leading LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) on a psychedelic art therapy interview transcript, conducting six independent runs per model. Results demonstrate Gemini achieves highest reliability ($\u03ba= 0.907$, cosine=95.3%), followed by GPT-4o ($\u03ba= 0.853$, cosine=92.6%) and Claude ($\u03ba= 0.842$, cosine=92.1%).

This study investigates whether incorporating road-facing views alongside driver-facing footage improves distraction detection accuracy in naturalistic driving conditions. Using synchronized dual-camera recordings from real-world driving, we benchmark three leading spatiotemporal action recognition architectures: SlowFast-R50, X3D-M, and SlowOnly-R50. Each model is evaluated under two input configurations: driver-only and stacked dual-view. Results show that while contextual inputs can improve detection in certain models, performance gains depend strongly on the underlying architecture. The single-pathway SlowOnly model achieved a 9.8 percent improvement with dual-view inputs, while the dual-pathway SlowFast model experienced a 7.2 percent drop in accuracy due to representational conflicts. These findings suggest that simply adding visual context is not sufficient and may lead to interference unless the architecture is specifically designed to support multi-view integration. This study presents one of the first systematic comparisons of single- and dual-view distraction detection models using naturalistic driving data and underscores the importance of fusion-aware design for future multimodal driver monitoring systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728\u9a7e\u9a76\u5206\u5fc3\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u878d\u5408\u9a7e\u9a76\u8005\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u9053\u8def\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u53cc\u89c6\u89d2\u53e0\u52a0\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u8868\u793a\u51b2\u7a81\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5fc3\u9a7e\u9a76\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u9a7e\u9a76\u8005\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u73af\u5883\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9\u9a7e\u9a76\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u662f\u5426\u7ed3\u5408\u9053\u8def\u89c6\u89d2\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u7136\u9a7e\u9a76\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u53cc\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u67b6\u6784\uff08SlowFast-R50\u3001X3D-M\u3001SlowOnly-R50\uff09\u4e0a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5355\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u53cc\u89c6\u56fe\u53e0\u52a0\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "SlowOnly\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53cc\u89c6\u89d2\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53479.8%\uff0c\u4f46SlowFast\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u8868\u793a\u51b2\u7a81\u5bfc\u81f4\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d7.2%\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u67b6\u6784\u9700\u4e13\u95e8\u652f\u6301\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u878d\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5355\u7eaf\u589e\u52a0\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9a7e\u9a76\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u878d\u5408\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

However, their efficacy is often compromised by the prevailing reliance on a single, static graph built from indiscriminate features, hindering the ability to model patient-specific pathological relationships. To this end, the proposed Multi-Activation Plane Interaction Graph Neural Network (MAPI-GNN) reconstructs this single-graph paradigm by learning a multifaceted graph profile from semantically disentangled feature subspaces.

Current methods often overlook the rich hierarchical structures, such as the semantic hierarchy of primitives (e.g., apple fruit) and the conceptual hierarchy between primitives and compositions (e.g, sliced apple apple). A few recent efforts have shown effectiveness in modeling these hierarchies through loss regularization within Euclidean space. In this paper, we argue that they fail to scale to the large-scale taxonomies required for real-world CZSL: the space's polynomial volume growth in flat geometry cannot match the exponential structure, impairing generalization capacity. To this end, we propose H2em, a new framework that learns Hierarchical Hyperbolic EMbeddings for CZSL. H2em leverages the unique properties of hyperbolic geometry, a space naturally suited for embedding tree-like structures with low distortion. However, a naive hyperbolic mapping may suffer from hierarchical collapse and poor fine-grained discrimination. We further design two learning objectives to structure this space: a Dual-Hierarchical Entailment Loss that uses hyperbolic entailment cones to enforce the predefined hierarchies, and a Discriminative Alignment Loss with hard negative mining to establish a large geodesic distance between semantically similar compositions. Furthermore, we devise Hyperbolic Cross-Modal Attention to realize instance-aware cross-modal infusion within hyperbolic geometry.

This task is particularly challenging for Mandarin, as visemes are highly ambiguous and homophones are prevalent. We propose VALLR-Pin, a novel two-stage framework that extends the recent VALLR architecture from English to Mandarin. First, a shared video encoder feeds into dual decoders, which jointly predict both Chinese character sequences and their standard Pinyin romanization. The multi-task learning of character and phonetic outputs fosters robust visual-semantic representations. During inference, the text decoder generates multiple candidate transcripts. We construct a prompt by concatenating the Pinyin output with these candidate Chinese sequences and feed it to a large language model to resolve ambiguities and refine the transcription. This provides the LLM with explicit phonetic context to correct homophone-induced errors. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM on synthetic noisy examples: we generate imperfect Pinyin-text pairs from intermediate VALLR-Pin checkpoints using the training data, creating instruction-response pairs for error correction. This endows the LLM with awareness of our model's specific error patterns.

Self-Awareness via Internal Circuits", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent and complex outputs but often fail to recognize their own mistakes and hallucinations. Existing approaches typically rely on external judges, multi-sample consistency, or text-based self-critique, which incur additional compute or correlate weakly with true correctness. We ask: can LLMs predict their own failures by inspecting internal states during inference? We introduce Gnosis, a lightweight self-awareness mechanism that enables frozen LLMs to perform intrinsic self-verification by decoding signals from hidden states and attention patterns. Gnosis passively observes internal traces, compresses them into fixed-budget descriptors, and predicts correctness with negligible inference cost, adding only ~5M parameters and operating independently of sequence length. Across math reasoning, open-domain question answering, and academic knowledge benchmarks, and over frozen backbones ranging from 1.7B to 20B parameters, Gnosis consistently outperforms strong internal baselines and large external judges in both accuracy and calibration. Moreover, it generalizes zero-shot to partial generations, enabling early detection of failing trajectories and compute-aware control. These results show that reliable correctness cues are intrinsic to generation process and can be extracted efficiently without external supervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "Gnosis\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u81ea\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u7801LLM\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u76d1\u7763\u5373\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u6216\u591a\u6837\u672c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f31\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22LLM\u80fd\u5426\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u67e5\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u81ea\u8eab\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "method": "Gnosis\u88ab\u52a8\u89c2\u5bdf\u5185\u90e8\u75d5\u8ff9\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u56fa\u5b9a\u9884\u7b97\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ea6500\u4e07\u53c2\u6570\u9884\u6d4b\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u6781\u4f4e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u5b66\u672f\u77e5\u8bc6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cGnosis\u57281.7B\u523020B\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u51bb\u7ed3\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u5927\u578b\u5916\u90e8\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u5185\u5728\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\uff0cGnosis\u53ef\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u90e8\u5206\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u5931\u8d25\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u611f\u77e5\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

To remove explicit masks at inference, we use self-supervision: we generate mouth-altered variants of the target image, that serve as pseudo ground truth for fine-tuning, teaching the network to localize edits to the lips while preserving the rest. Stage 2 is an audio-to-pose transformer trained with a flow-matching objective to predict lips-poses vectors from speech.

Cube available at https://github.com/dana-23/cube-bench", "summary": "We introduce Cube Bench, a Rubik's-cube benchmark for evaluating spatial and sequential reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The benchmark decomposes performance into five skills: (i) reconstructing cube faces from images and text, (ii) choosing the optimal next move, (iii) predicting the outcome of a candidate move without applying it, (iv) executing multi-step plans while recovering from mistakes, and (v) detecting and revising one's own errors. Using a shared set of scrambled cube states, identical prompts and parsers, and a single distance-to-solved metric, we compare recent MLLMs side by side as a function of scramble depth. Across seven MLLMs, accuracy drops sharply with depth; once a trajectory stalls or diverges, models rarely recover, and high face-reconstruction accuracy does not guarantee competent action selection or multi-step execution. A pronounced closed- vs open-source gap emerges: the strongest closed model leads on both single-step perception tasks and multi-step control tasks, while open-weight models cluster near chance on the hardest settings; yet even the best MLLM degrades at higher cube complexity.

We perform zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations of existing mainstream contrastive vision-language models and OCR-free visual document understanding (VDU) models. A two-stage retrieval method is further investigated for performance improvement while achieving both time and space efficiency. We hope the proposed NL-DIR benchmark can bring new opportunities and facilitate research for the VDU community.

Although deep learning-based HAR systems are widely adopted, the impact of Activation Functions (AFs) and Model Optimizers (MOs) on performance has not been sufficiently analyzed, particularly regarding how their combinations influence model behavior in practical scenarios. Most existing studies focus on architecture design, while the interaction between AF and MO choices remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we investigate the effect of three commonly used activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh) combined with four optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad) using two recurrent deep learning architectures, namely BiLSTM and ConvLSTM. Experiments are conducted on six medically relevant activity classes selected from the HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets, considering their suitability for healthcare-oriented HAR applications. Our experimental results show that ConvLSTM consistently outperforms BiLSTM across both datasets. ConvLSTM, combined with Adam or RMSprop, achieves an accuracy of up to 99.00%, demonstrating strong spatio-temporal learning capabilities and stable performance. While BiLSTM performs reasonably well on UCF101, with accuracy approaching 98.00%, its performance drops to approximately 60.00% on HMDB51, indicating limited robustness across datasets and weaker sensitivity to AF and MO variations.

Although previous methods achieve LiDAR point cloud generation from user inputs, they struggle to attain high-quality results while enabling versatile controllability, due to the imbalance between the complex distribution of LiDAR point clouds and the simple control signals. To address the limitation, we propose LiDARDraft, which utilizes the 3D layout to build a bridge between versatile conditional signals and LiDAR point clouds. The 3D layout can be trivially generated from various user inputs such as textual descriptions and images. Specifically, we represent text, images, and point clouds as unified 3D layouts, which are further transformed into semantic and depth control signals. Then, we employ a rangemap-based ControlNet to guide LiDAR point cloud generation.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework that unifies the strengths of both paradigms. A bidirectional transformer encodes multi-view image tokens and Plucker-ray embeddings, producing a shared latent representation. Two lightweight heads then act on this representation: (i) a feed-forward regression head that renders pixels where geometry is well constrained, and (ii) a masked autoregressive diffusion head that completes occluded or unseen regions. The entire model is trained end-to-end with joint photometric and diffusion losses, without handcrafted 3D inductive biases, enabling scalability across diverse scenes.

While Ground Penetrating Radar and Infrared Thermography enable subsurface defect detection, single modal approaches face complementary constraints radar struggles with moisture and shallow defects, while thermography exhibits weather dependency and limited depth. This paper presents a multi modal attention network fusing radar temporal patterns with thermal spatial signatures for bridge deck delamination detection. Our architecture introduces temporal attention for radar processing, spatial attention for thermal features, and cross modal fusion with learnable embeddings discovering complementary defect patterns invisible to individual sensors. We incorporate uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo dropout and learned variance estimation, decomposing uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components for safety critical decisions. Experiments on five bridge datasets reveal that on balanced to moderately imbalanced data, our approach substantially outperforms baselines in accuracy and AUC representing meaningful improvements over single modal and concatenation based fusion. Ablation studies demonstrate cross modal attention provides critical gains beyond within modality attention, while multi head mechanisms achieve improved calibration. Uncertainty quantification reduces calibration error, enabling selective prediction by rejecting uncertain cases. However, under extreme class imbalance, attention mechanisms show vulnerability to majority class collapse. These findings provide actionable guidance: attention based architecture performs well across typical scenarios, while extreme imbalance requires specialized techniques. Our system maintains deployment efficiency, enabling real time inspection with characterized capabilities and limitations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u63a2\u5730\u96f7\u8fbe\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u70ed\u6210\u50cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u68c0\u6d4b\u6865\u6881\u677f\u8131\u5c42\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u51b3\u7b56\uff1b\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u81f3\u4e2d\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5927\u5e45\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u5b58\u5728\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff1a\u63a2\u5730\u96f7\u8fbe\u5bf9\u6c34\u5206\u548c\u6d45\u8868\u7f3a\u9677\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u70ed\u6210\u50cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u5929\u6c14\u4e14\u6df1\u5ea6\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u96f7\u8fbe\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u70ed\u6210\u50cf\u4f7f\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63d0\u53d6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff1b\u96c6\u6210\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1bdropout\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5076\u7136\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6865\u6881\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u81f3\u4e2d\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548cAUC\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u7b80\u5355\u62fc\u63a5\u878d\u5408\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u952e\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u591a\u5934\u673a\u5236\u6539\u5584\u6821\u51c6\u5ea6\uff1b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u964d\u4f4e\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5178\u578b\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u6781\u7aef\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u65f6\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u591a\u6570\u7c7b\u5d29\u584c\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u660e\u786e\u80fd\u529b\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Existing pruning approaches treat either tokens or heads in isolation, relying on heuristics or first-order signals, which often sacrifice accuracy or fail to generalize across inputs. We introduce HEART-ViT, a Hessian-guided efficient dynamic attention and token pruning framework for vision transformers, which to the best of our knowledge is the first unified, second-order, input-adaptive framework for ViT optimization. HEART-ViT estimates curvature-weighted sensitivities of both tokens and attention heads using efficient Hessian-vector products, enabling principled pruning decisions under explicit loss budgets.This dual-view sensitivity reveals an important structural insight: token pruning dominates computational savings, while head pruning provides fine-grained redundancy removal, and their combination achieves a superior trade-off. On ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1K with ViT-B/16 and DeiT-B/16, HEART-ViT achieves up to 49.4 percent FLOPs reduction, 36 percent lower latency, and 46 percent higher throughput, while consistently matching or even surpassing baseline accuracy after fine-tuning, for example 4.7 percent recovery at 40 percent token pruning. Beyond theoretical benchmarks, we deploy HEART-ViT on different edge devices such as AGX Orin, demonstrating that our reductions in FLOPs and latency translate directly into real-world gains in inference speed and energy efficiency. HEART-ViT bridges the gap between theory and practice, delivering the first unified, curvature-driven pruning framework that is both accuracy-preserving and edge-efficient.", "AI": {"tldr": "HEART-ViT \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e Hessian \u7684\u3001\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e token \u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u9636\u4fe1\u606f\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9 Transformer \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9 Transformer \u5c3d\u7ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4e8c\u6b21\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e25\u91cd\u5236\u7ea6\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6216\u4e00\u9636\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u727a\u7272\u5927\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408 Hessian \u5411\u91cf\u79ef\u4f30\u7b97 token \u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u5934\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u52a0\u6743\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u635f\u5931\u9884\u7b97\u5b9e\u73b0\u526a\u679d\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u5316\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00 token \u526a\u679d\uff08\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u7701\uff09\u4e0e\u5934\u526a\u679d\uff08\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5197\u4f59\u53bb\u9664\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cHEART-ViT \u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe 49.4% \u7684\u6d6e\u70b9\u8fd0\u7b97\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e 36% \u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u63d0\u5347 46% \u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u57fa\u51c6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6301\u5e73\u6216\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u6b21\u6253\u901a\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e14\u8fb9\u7f18\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u66f2\u7387\u9a71\u52a8\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u80fd\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

However, the radar signals are often sparse due to specular reflection, making the extraction of robust features from radar signals highly challenging. To address this, we present milliMamba, a radar-based 2D human pose estimation framework that jointly models spatio-temporal dependencies across both the feature extraction and decoding stages. Specifically, given the high dimensionality of radar inputs, we adopt a Cross-View Fusion Mamba encoder to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from longer sequences with linear complexity. A Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention decoder then predicts joint coordinates across multiple frames. Together, this spatio-temporal modeling pipeline enables the model to leverage contextual cues from neighboring frames and joints to infer missing joints caused by specular reflections. To reinforce motion smoothness, we incorporate a velocity loss alongside the standard keypoint loss during training. Experiments on the TransHuPR and HuPR datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements, exceeding the baselines by 11.0 AP and 14.6 AP, respectively, while maintaining reasonable complexity.

One of the challenges is apple pose estimation, where key points, such as the calyx, are often occluded. Recently developed pose estimation methods no longer rely on these key points, but still require them for annotations, making annotating challenging and time-consuming. Due to the abovementioned occlusions, there can be conflicting and missing annotations of the same fruit between different images. Novel 3D reconstruction methods can be used to simplify annotating and enlarge datasets. We propose a novel pipeline consisting of 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct an orchard scene, simplified annotations, automated projection of the annotations to images, and the training and evaluation of a pose estimation method. Using our pipeline, 105 manual annotations were required to obtain 28,191 training labels, a reduction of 99.6%. Experimental results indicated that training with labels of fruits that are $\\leq95\\%$ occluded resulted in the best performance, with a neutral F1 score of 0.927 on the original images and 0.970 on the rendered images. Adjusting the size of the training dataset had small effects on the model performance in terms of F1 score and pose estimation accuracy. It was found that the least occluded fruits had the best position estimation, which worsened as the fruits became more occluded. It was also found that the tested pose estimation method was unable to correctly learn the orientation estimation of apples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u91cd\u5efa\u679c\u56ed\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u9700\u6c42\u4ece28191\u4e2a\u51cf\u5c11\u5230105\u4e2a\uff08\u51cf\u5c1199.6%\uff09\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u82f9\u679c\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u6807\u6ce8\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u679c\u56ed\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u9762\u4e34\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5f02\u548c\u906e\u6321\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u82f9\u679c\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5173\u952e\u70b9\uff08\u5982\u82b1\u843c\uff09\u5e38\u88ab\u906e\u6321\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u4e0d\u518d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u800c\u906e\u6321\u5bfc\u81f4\u6807\u6ce8\u51b2\u7a81\u548c\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7b80\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u7a0b\u5e76\u6269\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u542b3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u91cd\u5efa\u679c\u56ed\u573a\u666f\u3001\u7b80\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u6295\u5f71\u6807\u6ce8\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u65b0\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002\u5229\u75283D\u91cd\u5efa\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u9700\u6c42\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u226495%\u906e\u6321\u82f9\u679c\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6807\u7b7e\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5728\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0aF1\u5f97\u5206\u4e3a0.927\uff0c\u6e32\u67d3\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u4e3a0.970\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\uff0c\u906e\u6321\u6700\u5c11\u7684\u6c34\u679c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f30\u8ba1\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6b63\u786e\u5b66\u4e60\u82f9\u679c\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u906e\u6321\u589e\u52a0\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

A considerable challenge for modern low-shot counters are dense regions with small objects. While total counts in such situations are typically well addressed by density-based counters, their usefulness is limited by poor localization capabilities. This is better addressed by point-detection-based counters, which are based on query-based detectors. However, due to limited number of pre-trained queries, they underperform on images with very large numbers of objects, and resort to ad-hoc techniques like upsampling and tiling. We propose CoDi, the first latent diffusion-based low-shot counter that produces high-quality density maps on which object locations can be determined by non-maxima suppression. Our core contribution is the new exemplar-based conditioning module that extracts and adjusts the object prototypes to the intermediate layers of the denoising network, leading to accurate object location estimation. On FSC benchmark, CoDi outperforms state-of-the-art by 15% MAE, 13% MAE and 10% MAE in the few-shot, one-shot, and reference-less scenarios, respectively, and sets a new state-of-the-art on MCAC benchmark by outperforming the top method by 44% MAE.

However, they encounter difficulties in achieving both high-realism and high-fidelity at low bitrate, as the pixel-space distortion may not align with human perception. To address this issue, we introduce a Generative Latent Coding (GLC) architecture, which performs transform coding in the latent space of a generative vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE), instead of in the pixel space. The generative latent space is characterized by greater sparsity, richer semantic and better alignment with human perception, rendering it advantageous for achieving high-realism and high-fidelity compression. Additionally, we introduce a categorical hyper module to reduce the bit cost of hyper-information, and a code-prediction-based supervision to enhance the semantic consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our GLC maintains high visual quality with less than 0.04 bpp on natural images and less than 0.01 bpp on facial images. On the CLIC2020 test set, we achieve the same FID as MS-ILLM with 45% fewer bits.

The degradations present nonlinear coupling rather than simple superposition, which renders the effective processing of such coupled degradations particularly challenging. Most existing methods focus on designing specific branches, modules, or strategies for specific degradations, with little attention paid to the potential information embedded in their coupling. Consequently, they struggle to effectively capture and process the nonlinear interactions of multiple degradations from a bottom-up perspective. To address this issue, we propose JDPNet, a joint degradation processing network, that mines and unifies the potential information inherent in coupled degradations within a unified framework.

Current multi-modal 3D object detectors often rely on complex architectures and training strategies to achieve higher detection accuracy. However, these methods heavily rely on the LiDAR sensor so that they suffer from large performance drops when LiDAR is absent, which compromises the robustness and safety of autonomous systems in practical scenarios. Moreover, existing multi-modal detectors face difficulties in deployment on diverse hardware platforms, such as NPUs and FPGAs, due to their reliance on 3D sparse convolution operators, which are primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs. To address these challenges, we reconsider the role of LiDAR in the camera-LiDAR fusion paradigm and introduce a novel multi-modal 3D detector, LiteFusion. Instead of treating LiDAR point clouds as an independent modality with a separate feature extraction backbone, LiteFusion utilizes LiDAR data as a complementary source of geometric information to enhance camera-based detection. This straightforward approach completely eliminates the reliance on a 3D backbone, making the method highly deployment-friendly. Specifically, LiteFusion integrates complementary features from LiDAR points into image features within a quaternion space, where the orthogonal constraints are well-preserved during network training. This helps model domain-specific relations across modalities, yielding a compact cross-modal embedding. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that LiteFusion improves the baseline vision-based detector by +20.4% mAP and +19.7% NDS with a minimal increase in parameters (1.1%) without using dedicated LiDAR encoders.

This gap is especially pronounced for Indic documents, which encompass diverse scripts yet remain underrepresented in current datasets, further limiting progress in this space. To address these shortcomings, we introduce IndicDLP, a large-scale foundational document layout dataset spanning 11 representative Indic languages alongside English and 12 common document domains. Additionally, we curate UED-mini, a dataset derived from DocLayNet and M6Doc, to enhance pretraining and provide a solid foundation for Indic layout models. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning existing English models on IndicDLP significantly boosts performance, validating its effectiveness.

To address this challenge, we propose a Degradation-Aware Metric Prompting (DAMP) framework. Instead of relying on predefined degradation priors, we design spatial-spectral degradation metrics to continuously quantify multi-dimensional degradations, serving as Degradation Prompts (DP). These DP enable the model to capture cross-task similarities in degradation distributions and enhance shared feature learning. Furthermore, we introduce a Spatial-Spectral Adaptive Module (SSAM) that dynamically modulates spatial and spectral feature extraction through learnable parameters. By integrating SSAM as experts within a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, and using DP as the gating router, the framework enables adaptive, efficient, and robust restoration under diverse, mixed, or unseen degradations.

However, it has long faced the challenges of high inter-class similarity and large intra-class variability. Existing approaches often struggle to effectively inject abstract yet strongly discriminative semantic knowledge into pixel-level feature learning, leading to blurred boundaries and class confusion in complex scenes. To address these challenges, we propose Bidirectional Co-Refinement Framework for HRSS (BiCoR-Seg). Specifically, we design a Heatmap-driven Bidirectional Information Synergy Module (HBIS), which establishes a bidirectional information flow between feature maps and class embeddings by generating class-level heatmaps. Based on HBIS, we further introduce a hierarchical supervision strategy, where the interpretable heatmaps generated by each HBIS module are directly utilized as low-resolution segmentation predictions for supervision, thereby enhancing the discriminative capacity of shallow features. In addition, to further improve the discriminability of the embedding representations, we propose a cross-layer class embedding Fisher Discriminative Loss to enforce intra-class compactness and enlarge inter-class separability. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA, Vaihingen, and Potsdam datasets demonstrate that BiCoR-Seg achieves outstanding segmentation performance while offering stronger interpretability.

Recently, such techniques have been increasingly employed to distort narratives of important events and to spread misinformation on social media, prompting the development of misinformation detectors. In the context of misinformation conveyed through image-text pairs, several detection methods have been proposed. However, these approaches typically rely on computationally intensive architectures or require large amounts of annotated data. In this work we introduce LADLE-MM: Limited Annotation based Detector with Learned Ensembles for Multimodal Misinformation, a model-soup initialized multimodal misinformation detector designed to operate under a limited annotation setup and constrained training resources. LADLE-MM is composed of two unimodal branches and a third multimodal one that enhances image and text representations with additional multimodal embeddings extracted from BLIP, serving as fixed reference space. Despite using 60.3% fewer trainable parameters than previous state-of-the-art models, LADLE-MM achieves competitive performance on both binary and multi-label classification tasks on the DGM4 benchmark, outperforming existing methods when trained without grounding annotations.

Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias. By jointly exploiting the supervision signals from both the pseudo masks and scribble semantics, ${D}^{3}$ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "D\u00b3ETOR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u4f2a\u88c5\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fa9\u8bba\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u53bb\u504f\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6ce8\u91ca\u504f\u5dee\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u4f2a\u88c5\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u901a\u7528\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6d82\u9e26\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u83b7\u4f2a\u88c5\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u71b5\u9a71\u52a8\u70b9\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3aSAM\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u8bbe\u8ba1FADeNet\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u591a\u7ea7\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u76d1\u7763\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u6ce8\u91ca\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "D\u00b3ETOR\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u4f2a\u88c5\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5229\u7528\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u6d82\u9e26\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u4f2a\u88c5\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

This progress is driven by increasingly sophisticated model architectures, such as ResNets, Vision Transformers, and Hybrid Convolutional Neural Networks, that offer enhanced performance at the cost of greater complexity. This complexity often compromises model explainability and interpretability. SHAP has emerged as a prominent method for providing interpretable visualizations that aid domain experts in understanding model predictions. However, SHAP explanations can be unstable and unreliable in the presence of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. In this study, we address this challenge by using Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify the uncertainty that arises from these unstable explanations in medical imaging applications. The framework uses a belief, plausible, and fusion map approach alongside statistical quantitative analysis to produce quantification of uncertainty in SHAP. Furthermore, we evaluated our framework on three medical imaging datasets with varying class distributions, image qualities, and modality types which introduces noise due to varying image resolutions and modality-specific aspect covering the examples from pathology, ophthalmology, and radiology, introducing significant epistemic uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u91cf\u5316SHAP\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5e94\u7528\u4e2dSHAP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u72c4\u5229\u514b\u96f7\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u8bc1\u636e\u7406\u8bba\u6765\u5904\u7406\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u968f\u673a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u9886\u57df\u7684\u590d\u6742\u67b6\u6784\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u727a\u7272\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002SHAP\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u6d41\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65f6\u89e3\u91ca\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5173\u952e\u533b\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u72c4\u5229\u514b\u96f7\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u767b\u666e\u65af\u7279-\u8c22\u5f17\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4fe1\u5ff5\u56fe\u3001\u4f3c\u7136\u56fe\u548c\u878d\u5408\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u6765\u91cf\u5316SHAP\u89e3\u91ca\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u3001\u773c\u79d1\u548c\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u7531\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u91cf\u5316SHAP\u89e3\u91ca\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u591a\u53d8\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

They also incur high computational costs due to additional interaction modules introduced into DiTs, while the limited scale and quality of existing public datasets also restrict model generalization and effective training. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, KeyTailor, along with a large-scale, high-definition dataset, ViT-HD. The core idea of KeyTailor is a keyframe-driven details injection strategy, motivated by the fact that keyframes inherently contain both foreground dynamics and background consistency. Specifically, KeyTailor adopts an instruction-guided keyframe sampling strategy to filter informative frames from the input video. Subsequently,two tailored keyframe-driven modules, the garment details enhancement module and the collaborative background optimization module, are employed to distill garment dynamics into garment-related latents and to optimize the integrity of background latents, both guided by keyframes.These enriched details are then injected into standard DiT blocks together with pose, mask, and noise latents, enabling efficient and realistic try-on video synthesis. This design ensures consistency without explicitly modifying the DiT architecture, while simultaneously avoiding additional complexity. In addition, our dataset ViT-HD comprises 15, 070 high-quality video samples at a resolution of 810*1080, covering diverse garments.

However, existing approaches often rely on implicit, holistic critiques or unconstrained prompt rewrites, making their behavior difficult to interpret, control, or stop reliably. In contrast, large language models have benefited from explicit, structured forms of **thinking** based on verification, targeted correction, and early stopping.\n  We introduce CRAFT (Continuous Reasoning and Agentic Feedback Tuning), a training-free, model-agnostic framework that brings this structured reasoning paradigm to multimodal image generation. CRAFT decomposes a prompt into dependency-structured visual questions, veries generated images using a vision-language model, and applies targeted prompt edits through an LLM agent only where constraints fail. The process iterates with an explicit stopping criterion once all constraints are satised, yielding an interpretable and controllable inference-time renement loop.\n  Across multiple model families and challenging benchmarks, CRAFT consistently improves compositional accuracy, text rendering, and preference-based evaluations, with particularly strong gains for lightweight generators. Importantly, these improvements incur only a negligible inference-time overhead, allowing smaller or cheaper models to approach the quality of substantially more expensive systems. Our results suggest that explicitly structured, constraint-driven inference-time reasoning is a key ingredient for improving the reliability of multimodal generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "CRAFT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6216\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u91cd\u5199\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u505c\u6b62\u673a\u5236\u3002\u53d7\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u601d\u7ef4\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u5c06\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u4fee\u6b63\u548c\u65e9\u505c\u673a\u5236\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210", "method": "\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ec5\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u5931\u8d25\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u6267\u884c\u76f4\u5230\u6ee1\u8db3\u6240\u6709\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u548c\u6311\u6218\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCRAFT\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u7ec4\u5408\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6587\u672c\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u504f\u597d\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5f00\u9500\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8981\u7d20\uff0c\u53ef\u4f7f\u5c0f\u578b\u5ec9\u4ef7\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u66f4\u6602\u8d35\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u6c34\u5e73"}}

Inspired by 3D Gaussian Splatting, recent 2D Gaussian image models improve representation efficiency, yet existing methods struggle to balance compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity in ultra-high-resolution scenarios. To address this issue, we propose SmartSplat, a highly adaptive and feature-aware GS-based image compression framework that supports arbitrary image resolutions and compression ratios. SmartSplat leverages image-aware features such as gradients and color variances, introducing a Gradient-Color Guided Variational Sampling strategy together with an Exclusion-based Uniform Sampling scheme to improve the non-overlapping coverage of Gaussian primitives in pixel space. In addition, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Gaussian Color Sampling method to enhance color initialization across scales. Through joint optimization of spatial layout, scale, and color initialization, SmartSplat efficiently captures both local structures and global textures using a limited number of Gaussians, achieving high reconstruction quality under strong compression. Extensive experiments on DIV8K and a newly constructed 16K dataset demonstrate that SmartSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods at comparable compression ratios and exceeds their compression limits, showing strong scalability and practical applicability.

We explore exocentric video with ambient sensors as a non-intrusive, scalable alternative. While prior egocentric-wearable works predominantly adopt Global Alignment by encoding entire sequences into unified representations, this approach fails in exocentric-ambient settings due to two problems: (P1) inability to capture local details such as subtle motions, and (P2) over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns, causing misalignment between actions sharing similar temporal patterns with different spatio-semantic contexts. To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment. To align the decomposed features, our two-stage approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles easy negatives, hard negatives, and false negatives.

However, when applied to textured defect images, conventional anomaly detection methods have limitations including non-negligible misidentification, low robustness, and excessive reliance on large-scale and structured datasets. This paper proposes a texture basis integrated smooth decomposition (TBSD) approach, which is targeted at efficient anomaly detection in textured images with smooth backgrounds and sparse anomalies. Mathematical formulation of quasi-periodicity and its theoretical properties are investigated for image texture estimation. TBSD method consists of two principal processes: the first process learns the texture basis functions to effectively extract quasi-periodic texture patterns; the subsequent anomaly detection process utilizes that texture basis as prior knowledge to prevent texture misidentification and capture potential anomalies with high accuracy.The proposed method surpasses benchmarks with less misidentification, smaller training dataset requirement, and superior anomaly detection performance on both simulation and real-world datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7eb9\u7406\u57fa\u5e95\u96c6\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u5206\u89e3(TBSD)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7eb9\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7eb9\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u7528\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7eb9\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8bef\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fc7\u5f3a\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u5e73\u6ed1\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "TBSD\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u5b66\u4e60\u7eb9\u7406\u57fa\u5e95\u51fd\u6570\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7eb9\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5229\u7528\u7eb9\u7406\u57fa\u5e95\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u516c\u5f0f\u53ca\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTBSD\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u8bef\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9700\u6c42\u4ee5\u53ca\u66f4\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "TBSD\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u7eb9\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7eb9\u7406\u57fa\u5e95\u96c6\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u5206\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002"}}

However, most existing methods overlook physical cues such as joint actuation forces that are fundamental in biomechanics. This gap motivates our study: if and when do physically inferred forces enhance motion understanding? By incorporating forces into established motion understanding pipelines, we systematically evaluate their impact across baseline models on 3 major tasks: gait recognition, action recognition, and fine-grained video captioning. Across 8 benchmarks, incorporating forces yields consistent performance gains; for example, on CASIA-B, Rank-1 gait recognition accuracy improved from 89.52% to 90.39% (+0.87), with larger gain observed under challenging conditions: +2.7% when wearing a coat and +3.0% at the side view. On Gait3D, performance also increases from 46.0% to 47.3% (+1.3). In action recognition, CTR-GCN achieved +2.00% on Penn Action, while high-exertion classes like punching/slapping improved by +6.96%. Even in video captioning, Qwen2.5-VL's ROUGE-L score rose from 0.310 to 0.339 (+0.029), indicating that physics-inferred forces enhance temporal grounding and semantic richness.

While diffusion-based text-to-image models have demonstrated strong capabilities in visual content generation, their text rendering performance, particularly for small-scale typography and non-Latin scripts, remains limited. In this paper, we propose UTDesign, a unified framework for high-precision stylized text editing and conditional text generation in design images, supporting both English and Chinese scripts. Our framework introduces a novel DiT-based text style transfer model trained from scratch on a synthetic dataset, capable of generating transparent RGBA text foregrounds that preserve the style of reference glyphs. We further extend this model into a conditional text generation framework by training a multi-modal condition encoder on a curated dataset with detailed text annotations, enabling accurate, style-consistent text synthesis conditioned on background images, prompts, and layout specifications. Finally, we integrate our approach into a fully automated text-to-design (T2D) pipeline by incorporating pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models and an MLLM-based layout planner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UTDesign achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods in terms of stylistic consistency and text accuracy, and also exhibits unique advantages compared to proprietary commercial approaches.

This research evaluates adaptive Red-Green-Blue (RGB) and Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) fusion for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)-based detection of surface-laid landmines, leveraging the thermal contrast between the ordnance and the surrounding soil to enhance feature extraction. Using You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures (v8, v10, v11) across 114 test images, generating 35,640 model-condition evaluations, YOLOv11 achieved optimal performance (86.8% mAP), with 10 to 30% thermal fusion at 5 to 10m altitude identified as the optimal detection parameters. A complementary architectural comparison revealed that while RF-DETR achieved the highest accuracy (69.2% mAP), followed by Faster R-CNN (67.6%), YOLOv11 (64.2%), and RetinaNet (50.2%), YOLOv11 trained 17.7 times faster than the transformer-based RF-DETR (41 minutes versus 12 hours), presenting a critical accuracy-efficiency tradeoff for operational deployment. Aggregated multi-temporal training datasets outperformed season-specific approaches by 1.8 to 9.6%, suggesting that models benefit from exposure to diverse thermal conditions. Anti-Tank (AT) mines achieved 61.9% detection accuracy, compared with 19.2% for Anti-Personnel (AP) mines, reflecting both the size differential and thermal-mass differences between these ordnance classes.

We organize the work into five chapters, each addressing unique challenges in multimodal machine learning.\n  Chapter 3 introduces Spatial-Reasoning Bert for translating text-based spatial relations into 2D arrangements between clip-arts. This enables effective decoding of spatial language into visual representations, paving the way for automated scene generation aligned with human spatial understanding.\n  Chapter 4 presents a method for translating medical texts into specific 3D locations within an anatomical atlas. We introduce a loss function leveraging spatial co-occurrences of medical terms to create interpretable mappings, significantly enhancing medical text navigability.\n  Chapter 5 tackles translating structured text into canonical facts within knowledge graphs.

SirenPose incorporates physics inspired constraints to enforce coherent keypoint predictions across both spatial and temporal dimensions, while leveraging high frequency signal modeling to capture fine grained geometric details. We further expand the UniKPT dataset to 600,000 annotated instances and integrate graph neural networks to model keypoint relationships and structural correlations. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including Sintel, Bonn, and DAVIS demonstrate that SirenPose consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. On DAVIS, SirenPose achieves a 17.8 percent reduction in FVD, a 28.7 percent reduction in FID, and a 6.0 percent improvement in LPIPS compared to MoSCA. It also improves temporal consistency, geometric accuracy, user score, and motion smoothness.

A core challenge lies in effectively handling disparities in dynamic range and focus depth between the inputs. With the advent of vision-language models, recent methods incorporate textual descriptions as auxiliary guidance to enhance fusion quality. However, simply incorporating coarse-grained descriptions hampers the understanding of fine-grained details and poses challenges for precise cross-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-grained Text-guided Image Fusion (MTIF), a novel fusion paradigm with three key designs. First, it introduces multi-grained textual descriptions that separately capture fine details, structural cues, and semantic content, guiding image fusion through a hierarchical cross-modal modulation module. Second, it involves supervision signals at each granularity to facilitate alignment between visual and textual features and enhance the utility of auxiliary text. Third, it adopts a saliency-driven enrichment module to augment training data with dense semantic content, further strengthening the cross-modal modulation and alignment.

To bridge this gap across aspects of dataset, benchmark and model, we introduce DSR Suite. First, we propose an automated pipeline that generates multiple-choice question-answer pairs from in-the-wild videos for DSR. By leveraging modern vision foundation models, the pipeline extracts rich geometric and motion information, including camera poses, local point clouds, object masks, orientations, and 3D trajectories. These geometric cues enable the construction of DSR-Train for learning and further human-refined DSR-Bench for evaluation. Compared with previous works, our data emphasize (i) in-the-wild video sources, (ii) object- and scene-level 3D requirements, (iii) viewpoint transformations, (iv) multi-object interactions, and (v) fine-grained, procedural answers. Beyond data, we propose a lightweight Geometry Selection Module (GSM) to seamlessly integrate geometric priors into VLMs, which condenses question semantics and extracts question-relevant knowledge from pretrained 4D reconstruction priors into a compact set of geometry tokens. This targeted extraction avoids overwhelming the model with irrelevant knowledge.

Existing token reduction methods often ignore the textual query or rely on deep attention maps, whose instability under aggressive pruning leads to degraded semantic alignment.\n  We propose FlashVLM, a text guided visual token selection framework that dynamically adapts visual inputs to the query. Instead of relying on noisy attention weights, FlashVLM computes an explicit cross modal similarity between projected image tokens and normalized text embeddings in the language model space. This extrinsic relevance is fused with intrinsic visual saliency using log domain weighting and temperature controlled sharpening. In addition, a diversity preserving partition retains a minimal yet representative set of background tokens to maintain global context.\n  Under identical token budgets and evaluation protocols, FlashVLM achieves beyond lossless compression, slightly surpassing the unpruned baseline while pruning up to 77.8 percent of visual tokens on LLaVA 1.5, and maintaining 92.8 percent accuracy even under 94.4 percent compression.

Motivated by this gap, we empirically study how misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-based student observations can limit the effectiveness of imitation learning. More precisely, experts have significantly higher visibility (e.g., ignoring occlusions) and far lower uncertainty (e.g., knowing other vehicles' actions), making them difficult to imitate reliably. Furthermore, navigational intent (i.e., the route to follow) is under-specified in student models at test time via only a single target point. We demonstrate that these asymmetries can measurably limit driving performance in CARLA and offer practical interventions to address them. After careful modifications to narrow the gaps between expert and student, our TransFuser v6 (TFv6) student policy achieves a new state of the art on all major publicly available CARLA closed-loop benchmarks, reaching 95 DS on Bench2Drive and more than doubling prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13. Additionally, by integrating perception supervision from our dataset into a shared sim-to-real pipeline, we show consistent gains on the NAVSIM and Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End driving benchmarks.

We propose DiTracker, which adapts video DiTs through: (1) query-key attention matching, (2) lightweight LoRA tuning, and (3) cost fusion with a ResNet backbone. Despite training with 8 times smaller batch size, DiTracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging ITTO benchmark and matches or outperforms state-of-the-art models on TAP-Vid benchmarks.

Inspired by FedPIDAvg, we define a round-wise task for FedPOD to enhance training efficiency. FedPIDAvg achieved performance improvement by incorporating the training loss reduction for prediction entropy as weights using differential terms. Furthermore, by modeling data distribution with a Poisson distribution and using a PID controller, it reduced communication costs even in skewed data distribution. However, excluding participants classified as outliers based on the Poisson distribution can limit data utilization. Additionally, PID controller requires the same participants to be maintained throughout the federated learning process as it uses previous rounds' learning information in the current round. In our approach, FedPOD addresses these issues by including participants excluded as outliers, eliminating dependency on previous rounds' learning information, and applying a method for calculating validation loss at each round. In this challenge, FedPOD presents comparable performance to FedPIDAvg in metrics of Dice score, 0.78, 0.71 and 0.72 for WT, ET and TC in average, and projected convergence score, 0.74 in average. Furthermore, the concept of FedPOD draws inspiration from Kubernetes' smallest computing unit, POD, designed to be compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling. Extending round-wise tasks of FedPOD to POD units allows flexible design by applying scale-out similar to Kubernetes' auto-scaling.

Yet in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), this hierarchy remains poorly understood, as most studies focus on a narrow set of tasks. We introduce SpatialTree, a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchy that organizes spatial abilities into four levels: low-level perception (L1), mental mapping (L2), simulation (L3), and agentic competence (L4). Based on this taxonomy, we construct the first capability-centric hierarchical benchmark, thoroughly evaluating mainstream MLLMs across 27 sub-abilities. The evaluation results reveal a clear structure: L1 skills are largely orthogonal, whereas higher-level skills are strongly correlated, indicating increasing interdependency. Through targeted supervised fine-tuning, we uncover a surprising transfer dynamic-negative transfer within L1, but strong cross-level transfer from low- to high-level abilities with notable synergy. Finally, we explore how to improve the entire hierarchy. We find that naive RL that encourages extensive \"thinking\" is unreliable: it helps complex reasoning but hurts intuitive perception. We propose a simple auto-think strategy that suppresses unnecessary deliberation, enabling RL to consistently improve performance across all levels. By building SpatialTree, we provide a proof-of-concept framework for understanding and systematically scaling spatial abilities in MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SpatialTree\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u529b\u5206\u4e3a\u56db\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\uff0c\u5e76\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u5c42\u7ea7\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u6b21\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86auto-think\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u6539\u5584\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7814\u7a76\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u72ed\u7a84\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u96c6\u5408\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30MLLMs\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51faSpatialTree\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u529b\u5206\u4e3a\u56db\u7ea7\uff1a\u4f4e\u5c42\u611f\u77e5(L1)\u3001\u5fc3\u7406\u6620\u5c04(L2)\u3001\u6a21\u62df(L3)\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u529b(L4) 2) \u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5 3) \u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u6d41MLLMs\u572827\u4e2a\u5b50\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0 4) \u63a2\u7d22\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff1aL1\u6280\u80fd\u57fa\u672c\u6b63\u4ea4\uff0c\u800c\u9ad8\u5c42\u6280\u80fd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u8d1f\u5411\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b58\u5728\u4e8eL1\u5185\u90e8\uff0c\u4f46\u4ece\u4f4e\u5c42\u5230\u9ad8\u5c42\u7684\u8de8\u7ea7\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u63d0\u51faauto-think\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6291\u5236\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684", "conclusion": "SpatialTree\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u6269\u5c55MLLMs\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

While this approach can generate high-quality videos, it suffers from slow convergence and is computationally expensive when generating long videos. In this paper, we introduce SemanticGen, a novel solution to address these limitations by generating videos in the semantic space. Our main insight is that, due to the inherent redundancy in videos, the generation process should begin in a compact, high-level semantic space for global planning, followed by the addition of high-frequency details, rather than directly modeling a vast set of low-level video tokens using bi-directional attention. SemanticGen adopts a two-stage generation process. In the first stage, a diffusion model generates compact semantic video features, which define the global layout of the video. In the second stage, another diffusion model generates VAE latents conditioned on these semantic features to produce the final output. We observe that generation in the semantic space leads to faster convergence compared to the VAE latent space. Our method is also effective and computationally efficient when extended to long video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemanticGen produces high-quality videos and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and strong baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "SemanticGen\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u800c\u975eVAE\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u6162\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728VAE\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u6162\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u751f\u6210\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u89c6\u9891\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5b9a\u4e49\u89c6\u9891\u5168\u5c40\u5e03\u5c40\uff09\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u751f\u6210VAE\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u6765\u4ea7\u751f\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa", "result": "\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u6bd4VAE\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e14\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u5e76\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "SemanticGen\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u5c40\u89c4\u5212\u518d\u6dfb\u52a0\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u6536\u655b\u6162\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898"}}
